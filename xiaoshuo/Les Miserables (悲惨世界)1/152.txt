CHAPTER IV 

　　HE MAY BE OF USE
　　 Paris begins with the lounger and ends with the street Arab, two beings of which no other city is capable; the passive acceptance, which contents itself with gazing, and the inexhaustible initiative; Prudhomme and Fouillou.
　　Paris alone has this in its natural history. The whole of the monarchy is contained in the lounger; the whole of anarchy in the gamin.
　　This pale child of the Parisian faubourgs lives and develops, makes connections, "grows supple" in suffering, in the presence of social realities and of human things, a thoughtful witness. He thinks himself heedless; and he is not.
　　He looks and is on the verge of laughter; he is on the verge of something else also. Whoever you may be, if your name is Prejudice, Abuse, Ignorance, Oppression, Iniquity, Despotism, Injustice, Fanaticism, Tyranny, beware of the gaping gamin.
　　The little fellow will grow up.
　　Of what clay is he made?
　　Of the first mud that comes to hand. A handful of dirt, a breath, and behold Adam.
　　It suffices for a God to pass by.
　　A God has always passed over the street Arab. Fortune labors at this tiny being.
　　By the word "fortune" we mean chance, to some extent.
　　That pigmy kneaded out of common earth, ignorant, unlettered, giddy, vulgar, low.
　　Will that become an Ionian or a Boeotian?
　　Wait, currit rota, the Spirit of Paris, that demon which creates the children of chance and the men of destiny, reversing the process of the Latin potter, makes of a jug an amphora.

INT. HOVERCRAFT
Trinity blinks, shivering as her conscious exits the
Construct.
TRINITY
Neo!
TANK
What the hell just happened?
TRINITY
An Agent! You have to send me
back!
TANK
I can't!

INT. "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY
GUN REPORT THUNDERS through the underground, both men
BLASTING, moving at impossible speed.
For a blinking noment we enter BULLET-TIME.
Gun flash tongues curl from Neols gun, bullets float
forward like a plane noving across the sky, cartridges
cartwheel into space.
An instant later they are nearly on top of each other,
rolling up out of a move that is almost a mirrored
reflection of the other --
Each jamming their gun tight to the other's head.
They freeze in a kind of embrace; Neo sweating, panting,
Agent Smith machine-calm.
Agent Smith smiles.
AGENT SMITH
You're empty.
Neo pulls the TRIGGER. CLICK.
NEO
So are you.
The smile falls. Agent Smith yanks his TRIGGER.
CLICK.
Agent Smith's face warps with rage and he attacks, fist
flying at furious speed, blows and counters, Neo
retreating as --
A knife-hand opens his forearm, and a kick sends him
slamming back against a steel column.
Stunned, he ducks just under a punch that crunches into
the beam, STEEL CHUNKS EXPLODING like shrapnel.
Behind him, Neo leaps into the air, delivering a neck-
snapping reverse round-house. Agent Smith's glasses fly
off and he glares at Neo; his eyes, ice blue.
AGENT SMITH
You can't win.
NEO
I already have.
He attacks with a vicious series of blows but the Agent
seems to absorb them, waiting for his opening.
And this time Agent Smith's attack is too much, an
unrelenting fury, fists pounding like jackhammers.

INT. HOVERCRAFT
Trinity watches Neo as his body jerks, mouth coughing
blood, his life signs going wild.
TRINITY
Jesus, he's killing him!

INT. "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY
Agent Smith grabs hold of him, lifting him into the air,
hurling him against the curved wall of the train tunnel,
where he falls inches from the electrified third-rail.
The Agent is about to jump down, and press his attack
when he hears sonething. From deep in the tunnel, like
an animal cry; a burst of high-speed METAL GRINDING
against METAL.
The sound of an ON-COMING TRAIN.

INT. HOVERCRAFT
Tank is trying to find another entrance.
TRINITY
Send me back, Tank! Anywhere!
TANK
I'm looking, Trinity! I'm looking!
From the cockpit, an ALARM sounds. Morpheus hurries to
the front console, typing, bringing up the radar.
Trinity follows him.
TRINITY
What is it... oh no.
In every pipe surrounding them, they see the Extermination Unit.
TRINITY
Sentinels.

INT. SEWER MAIN
The killing machine we saw in the History Program blister
by us like tracer bullets shot down the throat of the abyss.

INT. "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY
Neo tries to get up. Agent Smith jumps down onto the
tracks and drop-kicks him in the face.
The world begins to shake, RUMBLING as the TRAIN NEARS.
AGENT SMITH
Do you hear that, Mr. Anderson?
Agent Smith grabs Neo in a choke-hold, forcing him to
look down the tracks, the train's headlight burning a
hole in the darkness.
AGENT SMITH
That is the sound of inevitability.
Neo sees it coming and he starts to fight.
AGENT SMITH
It is the sound of your death.
There is another METAL SCREECH, MUCH LOUDER, closer, as
Agent Smith tightens his hold. Neo is unable to breathe.
AGENT SMITH
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
The TRAIN ROARS at them, swallowing Agent Smith's words.
The veins bulge in Neo's head, as he grits through the pain.
He is not ready to die.
NEO
My name is Neo.
Impossibly, he hurls himself straight up, smashing Smith
against the concrete ceiling of the tunnel.
They fall as the sound and fury of the TRAIN EXPLODES
INTO the station.
Neo back-flips up off the tracks just as --
The train barrels over Agent Smith.
Neo stands, knees shaking, when the train slams on its
emergency brake. With an ear-splitting SHRIEK of
TORTURED RAILS, the train slows, part of it still in the
station.
Neo turns, limping, starting to run, racing for the
escalator --
As the train comes to a stop and the doors of the last
car open; Agent Smith bursts out in furious pursuit, his
glasses again intact.

INT. HOVERCRAFT
Morpheus checks the ship's self destruct key.
TRINITY
You can't use that until Neo is out!
MORPHEUS
I know. Don't worry, he'll make it.

EXT. CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
A man sits in his Mercedes, talking on his car phone when
his door is thrown open. Neo yanks him out and jumps in.
Further down the street, Agent Smith slows, calmly
touching his ear-piece.
Neo throws the car across traffic, rocketing down a side-
street.

INT. CAR (MATRIX) - DAY
Driving like a demon with one hand, he grabs the car
phone and dials long distance.
INT. HOVERCRAFT
Tank answers.
TANK
Operator.
NEO (V.O.)
Mr. Wizard, Get me the fuck out of here!

INT. CAR (MATRIX) - DAY
Looking over his shoulder, watching the mirrors, Neo
drives almost unconsciously.
NEO
Hurry, Tank! I got some serious pursuit!

INT. HOVERCRAFT
The keyboard clicking, Tank searches for an exit.
Trinity screams into the headset.
TRINITY
Neo, you better get your ass back here!

INT. CAR
NEO
I'm trying, Trinity. I'm trying.
TANK (V.O.)
I got one!
Neo glances to his right and sees Agent Brown, now
driving the car beside his. Agent Brown swerves,
slamming into him.
TANK (V.O.)
Wabash and Lake. A hotel.
Neo fights the steering wheel as Agent Brown pushes the
car up over the median.
TANK (V.O.)
Room 303.
Neo drops the phone as his car bucks into the opposing
lane --
Directly into the charging path of an enormous truck
driven by Agent Smith.
Neo dives from the Mercedes as the truck plows into it,
rending metal and GLASS, crushing through, totaling other
cars, as it EXPLODES.
Neo is up and running even as orange and black clouds
billow up behind hin.

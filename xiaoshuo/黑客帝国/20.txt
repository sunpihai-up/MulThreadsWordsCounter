EXT. ROOF (MATRIX) - DAY
The roof-access tower is now engulfed in flames as Neo
and Trinity lay waste to a dozen more Marines.
Guns and knives, like extensions of their bodies used
with the same deadly precision as their feet and their
fists.
Across the roof, the pilot inside the army helicopter
watches the ferocious onslaught.
PILOT
I repeat, we are under attack!
Suddenly his face, his whole body dissolves, consumed by
spreading locust-like swarm, of STATIC as --
Agent Jones emerges.
Just as she drops the last Marine, Trinity sees what's
coming.
Neo sees her, the fear in her face, and he knows what is
behind him.
Screaming, he whirls, GUNS filling his hands with
thought-speed.
Fingers PUMPING, SHELLS ejecting, dancing up and away, we
look through the sights and gun smoke at --
The Agent blurred with motion --
Until the HAMMERS CLICK against empty metal.
NEO
Trinity!
Agent Jones charges.
NEO
... help.
His GUN BOOMS as we enter the liquid space of --
Bullet-time.
The AIR SIZZLES with wads of lead-like angry flies as Neo
twists, bends, ducks just between them.
Agent Jones still running, narrows the gap, the BULLETS
coming faster until --
Neo bent impossibly back, one hand on the ground as a
spiraling gray ball shears open his shoulder.
He starts to scream as another digs a red groove across
his thigh.
He has only time to look up, to see the barrel when Agent
Jones, standing over him, pulls the TRIGGER the final
time.
CLICK. Empty.
Neo rolls, reaching for another gun when around-house
kick snaps his jaw. Agent Jones grabs the gun and levels
it at Neo.
AGENT JONES
Only human...
Suddenly Agent Jones stops. Something is wrong. He
scans the roof. Trinity is gone.
Immediately, he whirls around and turns straight into the
muzzle of her .45 --
Jammed right into his head.
TRINITY
Dodge this, motherfucker!
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The body flies back with a flash of
mercurial light and when it hits the ground --
It is the pilot.
Trinity helps Neo up.
NEO
Thanks.
TRINITY
You're hit --
NEO
I'm fine.
Neo is already looking at the helicopter.
NEO
Can you fly that thing?
TRINITY
Not yet.
She pulls out a cellular phone.

INT. HOVERCRAFT
Tank is back at the controls.
TANK
Operator.
TRINITY (V.O.)
Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
Tank is immediately searching the disk drawers.
TRINITY (V.O.)
Hurry!
His fingers flash over the gleaming laser disks, finding
one that he feeds into Trinityls supplement drive,
punching the "load" cormands on her keyboard.

EXT. ROOF (MATRIX) - DAY
Trinity's eyes flutter as information surges into her
brain, all the essentials of flying a helicopter absorbed
at light-speed.
TRINITY
Let's go.

INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY
Marines, trying to communicate with the men on the roof,
are beginning to panic when Agent Jones comes around the
corner.
SERGEANT
Sir! Sir! There was gunfire --
we've lost communication with the roof!
AGENT JONES
Remain at your posts.
SERGEANT
But, sir -- the fire -- we should evacuate!
AGENT JONES
You will do as you are ordered!
SERGEANT
Yes, sir.
Agent Jones marches into the Presidential Suite.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY
Agent Jones throws open the bedroom door and enters,
walking through the puddles pooling in the carpet.
Over the RUSHING WATER and the ALARMS, Agent Smith hears
a SOUND and understands the seriousness of the attack.
He turns to the wall of windows as the helicopter drops
INTO VIEW --
Neo is in the back bay, aiming the mounted .50 machine
gun.
AGENT SMITH
No.
The GUN jumps and BULLETS EXPLODE through the WINDOW in a cacophony of CRASHING GLASS --
As the Agents go for their weapons.
But Neo is too close, the .50 CALIBER too fast and
BULLETS are everywhere, perforating the room.
Agent Smith is hit first, his body jack-knifing back,
blood arcing out with a sudden flash of light --
Then Agent Brown, his GUN still FIRING as his body falls.
And finally Agent Jones.
Neo stares at Morpheus, trying to will him into action.
NEO
Get up, Morpheus! Get up!
Morpheus sits unmoving, his head still down.
Neo grabs the climbing rope just as marines burst into
the adjoining room.
He attaches only one end to his harness when they OPEN
FIRE.
Quickly he swings the GUN, SPRAYING the other room,
WINDOWS SHATTERING, FURNITURE EXPLODING, marines diving for cover.

INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY
Just outside the Presidential Suite, three marines
blister with snow-static.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY
Morpheus lifts his face into the room's rain. His eyes,
still white, begin to blink, twitch, then close.
And when he opens them, they are again dark and flashing
with fire.
The Agents knife into the room, FIRING even as Neo's
BULLET TRAILS chase them.
Morpheus strains at his handcuffs.
The Agents and the marines turn the tide, BLASTING LEAD,
RICOCHETING, POCK-MARKING the COPTER.
FIRING wildly, Neo turns to see Morpheus rising, snapping
the handcuffs, starting for the window.
Agent Smith stops and sees Morpheus run past the open
bedroom door.
AGENT SMITH
Nooo!
He FIRES, sweeping across the sheetrocked wall in a
perfect line.
For an instant, we see the BULLETS SHRED, PUNCTURING the
WALL, searing through the wet air with jet trails of
chalk.
And as Morpheus starts to dive for the window, a bullet
buries itself in his leg --
Knocking him off balance.
NEO
He won't make it.
Morpheus lunges, out of control --
As Neo spins, every move a whip crack --
Snapping the other rope-end onto a bolted bar.
Morpheus begins to fall when Neo hurls himself into the
wide blue empty space --
Flying for a moment.
The rope snaking out behind him; an umbilical cord
attached to a machine.
As their two bodies, set in motion, rushing at each other
on a seemingly magnetic course until --
They collide.
Almost bouncing free of each other, arms, legs,
scrambling, hands searching in furious desperation,
finding hold and clinging.
Until the line ends, snapping taut, cracking their
fragile embrace. Morpheus tumbles, legs flipping over,
falling down --
The ground deliriously distant --
As Neo snatches hold of his mentor's still handcuffed wrist.
NEO
Gotcha!
Trinity is already pulling the copter up and away.
As Agent Smith grabs the M-16 from the nearest marine.
He'll bring them all down. Targeting the helicopter, he
aims at something only he can see: the oil line.
PONK. PONK. PONK. The rear HULL is PUNCHED full of
holes and smoke and oil pours out like black blood.
TRINITY
Shit-shit-no!
Neo is pulling Morpheus up to him when he hears the
HELICOPTER BEGIN TO DIE.
NEO
Oh fuck.
Trinity throws the helicopter towards the roof of the
nearest building.
Morpheus and Neo cling to one another as they and the
machine above them begin to fall.
The ENGINE GRINDS, the CHOPPING BLADES start to slow
while --
The Agents stand in the open shattered window, watching
the helicopter disappear behind taller buildings.
Carried by its nomentum, Trinity guides the parabolic
fall over the nearest roof where --
Neo and Morpheus drop safely, rolling free as the rope
goes slack. Neo gets to his feet, trying to detach
himself but --
The helicopter is falling too fast, arcing over the roof
like a setting sun --
The coils of slack snap taught --
Yanking Neo off his feet, dragging him with ferocious
speed towards the edge even as --
Trinity lunges for the back door, her gun in one hand,
grabbing for the rope with the other --
Neo flies like a skipping stone, hurtling straight AT us,
when his feet hit the rain gutter --
A fulcrum that levers him up just as --
Trinity FIRES, severing the cord from the HELICOPTER,
falling free of it as it SMASHES, blades first into a
glass skyscraper.
Holding onto the rope she swings, connected to Neo, who
stands on the building's edge watching her arc beneath
him as the HELICOPTER EXPLODES --
She bounces against a shatterproof window that spider-
cracks out while FLAMES ERUPT behind her.

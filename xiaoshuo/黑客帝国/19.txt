INT. MAIN DECK
Trinity and Neo hang motionless in the suspension unit.
Tank is at the operations station.
TANK
Okay. Store's open. What do you
need?
TRINITY (V.O.)
Guns. Lots of guns.
TANK
Coming right up.
He loads the weapons disk.

INT. CONSTRUCT
Racks of weapons appear and Neo and Trinity arm
themselves.
TRINITY
No one has ever done anything like this.
NEO
Yeah?
He snap cocks an Uzi.
NEO
That's why it's going to work.
INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY
Agent Smith is again at the window.
AGENT SMITH
Why isn't the serum working?
AGENT BROWN
Perhaps we are asking the wrong
questions.
AGENT JONES
Or he doesn't know.
AGENT SMITH
Of course he knows. He's
resisting.
AGENT BROWN
How?
AGENT SMITH
I don't know. If I knew...
Agent Smith hides his knotting fist. He is becoming
angry. It is something that isn't supposed to happen to
agents.
AGENT SMITH
Leave me with him.
Agent Brown and Jones look at each other.
AGENT SMITH
Now!
INT. MAIN DECK
Tank sits down beside Morpheus whose face is ashen like
someone near death. He takes hold of his hand.
TANK
Hold on, Morpheus. They're coming for you. They're coming.

EXT. NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY
A dark wind blows.

INT. NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY
In long, black coats, Trinity and Neo push through the revolving doors.
Neo is carrying a duffel bag. Trinity has a large metal suitcase. They cut across the lobby drawing nervous glances.
Dark glasses, game faces.
Several plainclothes cops try to stop them. They are met
by the MUTED SPIT of a SILENCED GUN and the RAZORED
WHISTLE of THROWING STARS.
The cops slump down to the marbled floor while Neo and
Trinity do not even break stride.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY
Agent Smith leans close to Morpheus, whispering to him.
AGENT SMITH
Can you hear me, Morpheus? I'm going to be honest with you.
He removes his earphone, letting it dangle over his shoulder.
AGENT SMITH
I hate this place. This zoo. This prison. This reality,
whatever you want to call it, I can't stand it any longer. It's
the smell, if there is such a thing. I feel saturated by it. I
can taste your stink and every time I do, I fear that I've
somehow been infected by it.
He wipes sweat from Morpheus' forehead, coating the tips
of his fingers, holding them to Morpheus' nose.
AGENT SMITH
Repulsive, isn't it?
He lifts Morpheus' head, holding it tightly with both hands.
AGENT SMITH
I must get out of here, I must get free. In this mind is tlie key.
My key.
Morpheus sneers through his pain.
AGENT SMITH
Once Zion is gone, there's no need for me to be here. Do you
understand? I need the codes. I have to get inside Zion. You have
to tell me how.
He begins squeezing, his fingers gouging into his flesh.
AGENT SMITH
Tell me! Tell me!
The skull is about to shatter when Agents Jones and Brown
burst into the room. Agent Smith releases Morpheus.
AGENT BROWN
What were you doing?
Agent Smith recovers, replacing his ear piece.
AGENT JONES
You don't know.
AGENT SMITH
Know what?
Agent Smith listens to his earphone, not believing what
he is hearing.

INT. ELEVATORS (MATRIX) - DAY
They get in. Trinity immediately drops and opens the
suitcase, wiring a plastique and napalm bomb.
Beneath their trench coats is an arsenal of weapons slung
from climbing harnesses.
Neo hits the emergency stop. He pulls down part of the
false ceiling and finds the elevator shaft access panel.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY
Agent Jones looks at Morpheus.
AGENT JONES
I think they're trying to save
him.

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (MATRIX) - DAY
Neo ratchets down a clamp onto the elevator cable. Both
of them lock on. He looks up the long, dark throat of
the building and takes a deep breath.
NEO
There is no spoon.
Neo whips out his gun and presses it to the cable, lower
than where they attached themselves.
BOOM! The CABLE SNAPS.
The counter-weights plummet, yanking Trinity and Neo up
through the shaft as --
The elevator falls away beneath them, distending space,
filling it with the sound of WHISTLING METAL as they soar
to the top.

INT. LOBBY (MATRIX) - DAY
The ELEVATOR hits the botton.
BA-BOOM!
The massive EXPLOSION blows open the doors, fire clouds
engulfing the elevator section of the lobby.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY
The Agents hear the BLAST AND FIRE ALARMS.
AGENT JONES
Lower level --
AGENT BROWN
They are actually attacking.

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (MATRIX) - DAY
Hanging by a rope, Trinity hot-wires the panel for the door.

INT. TOP FLOOR (MATRIX) - DAY
Nervous, the Marines watch as the ELEVATOR "DINGS" softly
and slides open.
Black smoke rises out of the exposed shaft.
The nearest Marine eases to the edge, peering down at the
churning blaze engulfing the lower levels.
He does not see Trinity and Neo above him until it is too
late.
Krack! Neo kicks, knocking the Marine flying down into
the shaft.
Before the others can react, Trinity flips out into the
hall, decking the nearest Marine. Neo cracks another.
The fight is over before it begins.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY
An enormous EXPLOSION THUNDERS above them, shaking the
building. The ALARM SOUNDS, emergency sprinklers begin
showering the room.
Agent Smith smashes a table.
AGENT SMITH
Find them and destroy them!
Agent Jones nods and touches his ear piece.

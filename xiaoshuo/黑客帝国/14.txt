INT. ANTECHAMBER (MATRIX) - DAY
Morpheus rises from a bench as the Priestess escorts Neo
out. When they are alone, Morpheus puts his hand on
Neo's shoulder.
MORPHEUS
You don't have to tell me
anything, Neo, because I already
know what she said.
NEO
You do?
MORPHEUS
I brought you so that you could
hear it for yourself. I knew it
would help.
Neo finishes his cookie.
MORPHEUS
No one will ever ask you because
it is a gift from her. It is for
you and you alone.

EXT. CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
Storm clouds shroud the streets as the sky turns
jaundice.
Cypher nervously glances down the surrounding streets.
He notices several unmarked white vans.
He mops the sweat from his forehead, when Trinity sees
the black Lincoln.
TRINITY
Here they come.

INT. MAIN DECK
In the hovercraft, we see the sweat rolling down Cypher's
face and neck.
Tank is typing rapidly at the keyboard.
TANK
Weird. This area never has this
much activity.

EXT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY
Apoc opens the side door and they enter the hotel.

INT. ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY
Mouse's CELLULAR RINGS.
MOUSE
Welcome to Movie-Phone.
TANK (V.O.)
They're on their way.
MOUSE
Right.
The phone flips shut as he jumps up.
MOUSE
Let's get to work.

INT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY
Light filters down the throat of the building through a
caged skylight at the top of the open elevator shaft.
Four figures glide up the dark stairs that wind around
the antique elevator.
Neo notices a black cat, a yellow-green-eyed shadow that
slinks past them and pads quickly down the stairs.
A moment later, Neo sees another black cat that looks and
moves identically to the first one.
NEO
Whoa. Deja vu.
Those words stop the others dead in their tracks.

INT. MAIN DECK
The monitors suddenly glitch as though the Matrix had an
electronic seizure.
TANK
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

INT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY
Trinity turns around, her face tight.
TRINITY
What did you just say?
NEO
Nothing. Just had a little deja vu.
TRINITY
What happened? What did you see?
NEO
A black cat went past us and then
I saw another that looked just
like it.
TRINITY
How much like it? Was it the same
cat?
NEO
It might have been. I'm not sure.
Trinity looks at Morpheus, who listens quietly to the
rasping breath of the old building.
NEO
What is it?
TRINITY
A deja vu is usually a glitch in
the Matrix. It happens when they
change something.
She also listens as the staccato BEAT of HELICOPTER
BLADES GROW ominously LOUDER.

INT. MAIN DECK
Tank sees what was changed.
TANK
It's a trap!

INT. STAIRCASE (MATRIX) - DAY
Morpheus looks up the stairs as a helicopter shadow
passes over the clouded glass.
MORPHEUS
Come on!

INT. ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY
Cable goes to the draped windows.
CABLE
Did you just feel something weird?
MOUSE
Yeah...
The CELLULAR RINGS.

INT. BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY
Heavy bolt-cutters snap through the main phone cable.

INT. ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY
Mouse answers the phone.
MOUSE
What's going on?
TANK (V.O.)
They cut the hard-line! It's a trap! Get out!
Cable yanks open the curtain.
CABLE
Oh, no.
The windows are bricked up.

INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY
The door to the roof explodes open as heavily-armed rnen
rush towards room 1313.

INT. MAIN DECK
Tank watches helplessly.
TANK
No, no, no.

INT. ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY
The door slams open and the police force pours in, dozens
of assault rifles surrounding Mouse and Cable who are
armed with only handguns.
CABLE
Morpheus! It's a trap --

INT. STAIRS (MATRIX) - DAY
Morpheus stops as the scream is drowned by the REPORT of
MACHINE GUNS filling the building with a terrible fury.
TRINITY
Oh, God.

INT. MAIN DECK
Mouse's body thrashes against its harness as --

INT. ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY
BULLETS POUND him against the blood-splattered brick
window. Gun smoke thickens the room, Cable blasting and
moving until --
The HAMMER CLICKS empty. He screams as a DOZEN GUNS OPEN FIRE, ripping him apart.

INT. MAIN DECK
Blood spits from Cable's mouth, his body spasming, then
lying perfectly still.
The flat-line ALARM softly cries out from the life
MONITORS of the two dead men.

EXT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY
More police cars arrive as cops break open the lobby
doors.

INT. STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY
Flying downstairs, Morpheus stops, hearing the police
swarming below. He turns and rushes down the hall of the
eighth floor. At the end of it, he finds the bricked-up
windows.
CYPHER
That's what they changed. We're trapped. There's no way out.
The sound of heavy BOOT-STEPS close around them with the
mechanical sureness of a vice.
MORPHEUS
Give me your phone.
TRINITY
They'll be able to track it.
MORPHEUS
We have no choice.

INT. MAIN DECK
Tank answers the call.
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Tank, find a structural drawing of
this building and find it fast.
His fingers pound the keyboard.

INT. LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY
Flashlights probe the rotting darkness as the police
search every floor.

INT. MAIN DECK
The diagram windows onto the screen.
TANK
Got it.
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
I need the main wet-wall.

INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY
Agent Smith pauses, his hand going to his earpiece.

INT. ROOM 808 (MATRIX) - DAY
Morpheus is guided by Tank.
TANK (V.O.)
Now left and that's it in front of you.
MORPHEUS
Good.
He cuts off the phone.

INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY
Agent Smith hears the LINE CLICK dead.
AGENT SMITH
Eighth floor. They're on the eighth floor.

INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY
Agent Brown hears Smith on his earphone.
AGENT BROWTJ
Eighth floor! Move!

INT. STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY
Cops flood the eighth floor, rushing everywhere.

INT. ROOM 808 (MATRIX) - DAY
Several cops sweep through the room. It is empty. As
they pass the bathroom, we see a man-sized hole smashed
through the plaster and lathe.

INT. WALL (MATRIX) - DAY
They are inside the main plumbing wall, slowly worming
their way down the greasy, black stack pipes.
Above them, light fills the hole they made to get inside.
INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY
Brown turns to Smith.
AGENT BROWN
Where are they?

INT. ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY
The cops search in silence, straining for a clue, when
one hears SOMETHING STRANGE near the bathroom.

INT. WALL (MATRIX) - DAY
Cypher has slipped and is wedged between the wall and
several thick supply pipes.

INT. ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY
The Cop leans in, his ear almost against the thin
membrane of plaster separating them. He can hear
WHISPERS, HISSES and a GRUNT when --
The WALL suddenly bulges, SHATTER-CRACKING 
as the Cop realizes --
COP
They're in the walls!

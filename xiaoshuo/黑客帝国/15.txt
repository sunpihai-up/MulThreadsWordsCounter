INT. WALL (MATRIX) - DAY
Neo pulls Cypher free just as the Cop OPENS FIRE --
BULLETS PUNCHING shafts of light like swords into the box
of soot-black space.

INT. ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY
The Cop keeps FIRING, his flashlight strapped to his gun
barrel, lighting up the wall until --
A BULLET spits out his forehead. Agent Smith watches the
BODY fall with a THUD.
AGENT SMITH
Are orders that hard to follow?
I'll say it again. Morpheus must
be taken alive. Understand?

INT. WALL (MATRIX) - DAY
They're almost falling, they're climbing so fast.
Above them, plaster is smashed open as crunbling bits
shower down on them, filling the crawlway with dust.

INT. ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY
Agent Smith looks into the open wall, at the exposed
intestines of the building, and realizes where they are
going.
AGENT SMITH
How like a rodent.

INT. WALL (MATRIX) - DAY
Just below, a RIFLE-BUTT SMASHES open the WALL, light
raking across the lathe.
COP
I got him! I got him!
Trinity finds her gun first. BULLET-HOLES POP out the
WALL as she STRAFES the room, sending cops diving for
cover.
They continue, Trinity exposed for a roment, when a
creeping cop smashes a fist through and grabs a fistful
of her hair.
He starts to yank her out when Neo kicks, his boot
bursting through plaster and splintering lathe, knocking
the Cop out.
They then quickly sink out of sight.

INT. BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY
This part of the basement, a dark concrete cavern, was
the main mechanical room. There are four enormous
boilers, dinosaur-like technology that once pumped hot
water like arteries.
Black and bloody, they squeeze out from the ceiling into
the tangled web of pipes.
Their enemies are waiting for them.
Blinding lights cut open the darkness as gas-masked
figures FIRE GRENADE LAUNCHERS.
Smoke blossoms from the green-metal canisters.
Morpheus never stops moving. Searching the floor, he
finds what.he needs; the cover of the catch basin.
Cypher watches him pry open the grate, when a gas can
bounces near him.
MORPHEUS
Come on!
Cypher seems to trip as the cloud envelops him.

INT. MAIN DECK
Cypher's body begins to shiver uncontrollably.
TANK
Nerve gas.

INT. BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY
Morpheus watches Cypher disappear into the smoke then
follows the others down the wet-black hole.

INT. CATCH BASIN (MATRIX) - DAY
They crawl through greasy black water in a three foot
diameter pipe that feeds into the sewer main.

INT. BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY
Gas-masked apparitions find the open hole.

EXT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY
Cypher is carried out, hand-cuffed, his body still
shaking, mucus bubbling out his nose. As he is led past
Agent Smith, it almost seems that both men smile.
AGENT SMITH
We have them now.

INT. SEWER MAIN (MATRIX) - DAY
Neo punches out the screen and then spills down into the
main water trough.
Oily water forms around them as they wade across the man-
made underground river, towards the service catwalk.
Neo is about to pull himself out when he sees them coming.
Flashlights and laser sites sweep at them as cops in
helmets and heavy armor, looking more nachine than human,
fill both ends of the tunnel.
There is a single manhole cover above them.
Morpheus whispers to Trinity.
MORPHEUS
You have to get Neo out. Understand? That's all that
matters now.
TRINITY
Morpheus, don't --
MORPHEUS
He must get out. Do you understand me?
She nods.
A font of water erupts as Morpheus leaps for the manhole
ladder, his coat flying open like the wings of a manta ray.
COPS
There he is! That's him!
Pools of light wash over him as he hauls himself to the
surface.
COP
He's heading for the street!
Trinity urges the others to follow her. Grabbing Neo,
they wade quietly away from the chaos.

EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
Morpheus shoots out of the sewer but the police are
waiting for him. The closest cop is armed with a
tranquilized gun. He fires --
But Morpheus' is too fast, using the manhole cover as a
shield, blocking the darts, then --
Frisbee-ing it into the cop's armored chest, knocking him
off his feet.
The cops lunge at him but every part of his body is a
deadly weapon moving with impossible speed.
It seems he might fight his way out when he throws a
spinning back fist that is caught by --
Agent Smith.
AGENT SMITH
So, we meet at last.
MORPHEUS
And you are?
AGENT SMITH
Smith. I am Agent Smith.
MORPHEUS
You all look the same to me.
AGENT SMITH
I've been waiting for this noment.
Faster than a snake spits, Morpheus cracks Smith with a
jaw-breaking right.
MORPHEUS
Oh, so have I.
Agent Smith smiles.

INT. SEWER MAIN (MATRIX) - DAY
Trinity leads the others, fading into the darkness of the
tunnel, lit only with shafts of lights streaming through
the street drains as we RISE TOWARDS them --
THROUGH a grate INTO the fight.

EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
Smith and Morpheus exchange a furious serious of blows
that is witnessed but not believed by the surrounding
police.
Agent Smith delivers a punishing kick that staggers
Morpheus.
AGENT SMITH
You can't win.
Morpheus smiles.
MORPHEUS
I already have.
He stands up and drops his fists; a steely resolve in his
eyes.
AGENT SMITH
Take him.
Cops swarm over Morpheus.

INT. MAIN DECK
Tank reaches out to the screen as if reaching for
Morpheus.
TANK
No!

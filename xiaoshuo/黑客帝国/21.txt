INT. MAIN DECK
Tank stares at the screen, his mouth agape.
TANK
He's the One. He's got to be...

EXT. ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY
Neo pulls Trinity up into his arms. Both shaking, they hold each other again.
MORPHEUS
I knew it! I goddamn knew it!
TRINITY
Morpheus!
She runs at him, throwing her arms around him.
MORPHEUS
Do you believe me now? He's the One! Who else could have done
this?
NEO
Morpheus, I know you won't believe me but the Oracle told ne I'm not the One.
MORPHEUS
It doesn't matter if I don't believe you --
His eyes light up.
MORPHEUS
What matters is that you don't believe her.

INT. MAIN DECK
The PHONE RINGS.
TRINITY (V.O.)
Tank, get us out of here.
TANK
Got one ready. An underground El station. State and Balbo.
TRINITY (V.O.)
See ya soon.
LINE GOES DEAD. Tank looks at the bodies and smiles.
TANK
See ya soon.

EXT. ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY
The rope is all that remains. Agent Smith can barely control his anger.
AGENT BROWN
The trace was completed.
AGENT JONES
We have their position.
AGENT BROWN
The extermination unit is in place.
AGENT JONES
Order the strike.
Agent Smith can't stand listening to them. He moves to the edge of the building, looking out at the surrounding city.
AGENT SMITH
They're not out yet.

INT. "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY
A metal gate is locked, the sign reading, "Station Closed." Neo looks around, takes out a GUN and BLOWS OFF the LOCK.
In the moist underground distance they hear the MUTED RING of a TELEPHONE.
The PHONE is RINGING inside a graffiti-covered booth.
Across from it, sitting hunched against the red concrete wall, is an OLD MAN. He stares at the RINGING PHONE, taking a final pull off his T-bird. No one is around. It continues to RING.
Determined, he stands and walks to the booth. He is about to answer the phone, when Neo sees him.
NEO
Don't!
The Old Man stops, Neo rushes at hin, gliding smoothly over the turnstiles.
OLD MAN
I'm sorry -- I didn't mean!
The Old Man is shaking, terrified. Neo looks at his gun. He glances over his shoulder, then eases back the hammer.
NEO
Get outta here. Okay? Run! Go!
The Old Man nods, turns and hurries deeper into the urban cave, disappearing into the shadows as Trinity and Morpheus arrive.
TRINITY
What happened? Was that --
NEO
It was nobody.
Neo turns to the RINGING BOOTH.
NEO
Let's go! You first, Morpheus.
Morpheus gets in and answers the phone.
Lost in the shadow, the Old Man turns back and watches as Morpheus disappears, the phone dropping, dangling by its cord.
His eyes grow wide, glowing white in the dark.

EXT. ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY
Agent Smith stares, his face twisted with hate. He will never be free of the Matrix.
He starts to turn from the edge of the building when he suddenly hears it, his head whipping back around, staring --

INT. "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY
As the Old Man stares.
Trinity hangs up the phone. She turns to Neo, standing close enough to kiss him.
TRINITY
Morpheus is right, you know. It doesn't matter what he believes or
even what the Oracle believes. What matters is what you believe.
NEO
I believe...
He stares at the fullness of her lips.
NEO
I want to kiss you.
She smiles.
TRINITY
I want to kiss you too...
The PHONE begins to RING.
TRINITY
But I want it to be real.
She pulls herself away and gets into the booth when something catches Neo's eye and he looks to where the Old Man had been.
She hears him SCREAM and sees Agent Smith emerge as if formed by congealing darkness, charging with a fistful of metal.
The GUN FIRES, the BULLET flying at her, BURSTING through
the plastic WINDOW just as --
Trinity disappears.
The handset hanging in the air as the BULLET HITS, SHATTERING the EAR-PIECE.

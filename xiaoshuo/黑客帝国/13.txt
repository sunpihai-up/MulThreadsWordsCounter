EXT. CHICAGO (MATRIX) - DAY
An El train.

INT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY
The room is empty, heavy curtains covering windows. It
looks as if it hasn't been touched in years. In the
bedroom with the cracked oval mirror an old black PHONE
begins to RING.
In the mirror, we first glimpse them and as we keep
TURNING, the room fills with equipment and the team.
Morpheus answers the phone.
MORPHEUS
We're in.
He hangs up.
MORPHEUS
Mouse and Cable hold the exit.
Let's go.

INT. STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY
Neo follows the others down the stairwell that winds
around an antique elevator shaft.
NEO
Did you have to do this?
TRINITY
Yeah.
NEO
What did she tell you?
TRINITY
Lots of things.
NEO
Any of them true?
Trinity looks at him, then looks away.
TRINITY
Some of them.
GIZMO
Were they good or bad?
TRINITY
There's no point in worrylng. Whatever is going to happen is
going to happen.
They cross the old lobby. Switch and Apoc stop at the
doors.
MORPHEUS
We should be back in an hour.

EXT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY
Neo squints into the sun that seems unnaturally bright.
He is the only one without sunglasses.
MORPHEUS
Do you now understand what it
means when we say, if you're not
one of us, you're one of them?
NEO
The agents. They're sentient
programs. They can commandeer any
software hardwired to the
mainframe.
MORPHEUS
Anyone that is still in a power
plant. That is why we try to be
invisible in the Matrix.
NEO
The best hacking is always traceless.
Cypher and Trinity move away from them, securing the
perimeter. As Cypher passes a garbage can, he
surreptitiously drops something inside.
It is a cellular phone and we watch the blue display as
the LINE CONNECTS.
An early 1970s, black Lincoln Continental emerges from a
corrugated roll-up garage. Morpheus and Neo get in.

INT. LINCOLN CONTINENTAL (MATRIX) - DAY
An enormous man is waiting for them. A wad of chewing
tobacco bulges his cheek. He spits into a Coke can.
MOJO
Morpheus, been a long time coming.
MORPHEUS
You're looking well, Mojo.
Mojo coughs a brown, cankerous laugh, juice speckling his
chin and shirt. He stares at Neo.
MOJO
You bringing us geriatrics now. Morpheus?
He spits and laughs again.
MOJO
Guess you are locking for a miracle.

EXT. BAR (MATRIX) - DAY
The Continental pulls up to a bar in the kind of
neighborhood where every corner has a pair of eyes.

INT. BAR (MATRIX) - DAY
A lightless, lower-class bar. No one enters that is not
expected.
The front doors open in a brilliant burst of sunlight as
Mojo leads Morpheus and Neo inside. Neo looks around,
his eyes adjusting to the darkness.
Mojo talks to the bartender, then looks over.
MOJO
All right, it's cool. Go on back.
They weave their way to the back of the bar, the STICKY
FLOOR SNAPPING under their FEET.
A monolith of a man rises from his stool as they walk up.
REX
You're late.
He moves to the side, opening the heavy iron door behind
him. They descend the basement staircase toward the
single bare bulb at the bottom, hanging above the only
door.

INT. BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY
A high-tech laptop and modem are set up on a stack of
milk crates. Neo waits as Morpheus types in a series of
access codes. After a moment the screen blinks, "Welcome
Morpheus."
Morpheus walks back to the same door they entered, but it
now leads into --

INT. TEMPLE OF ZION (MATRIX) - DAY
The walls and floors are polished marble. Neo follows,
his mouth agape.
NEO
What -- what happened?
MORPHEUS
This is the temple. It is a part of Zion's mainframe. It's hidden
inside the Matrix so that we can access it.
Two PRIESTESSES are waiting in the antechamber.
PRIESTESS
Hello, Morpheus. We've been expecting you.
MORPHEUS
Okay, you're on your own. Go with
them.
They take Neo by the arm, leading him down a hall into
another room.
PRIESTESS
Wait here. Among the other Potentials.

INT. ROOM OF POTENTIALS (MATRIX) - DAY
Neo enters and finally understands the attention given to
his age. The Potentials are all little children.
The room feels at once like a Buddhist temple and a
kindergarten class. The children's heads are either
shaved or thick with dreadlocks. Some are playing,
others meditating or practicing their gift.
Neo watches a little girl levitate wooden alphabet
blocks. A skinny BOY holds a SPOON which sways like a
blade of grass as he bends it with his rnind.
Neo crosses to him, sits.
The Boy smiles as Neo picks up a spoon and tries to
imitate him. Despite his best efforts, Neo cannot make
it bend.
SPOON BOY
Your spoon does not bend because it is just that, a spoon. Mine
bends because there is no spoon, just my mind.
Neo watches as it curls into a knot.
SPOON BOY
Link yourself to the spoon. Become the spoon and bend
yourself.
Neo nods, again holding up his spoon.
NEO
There is no spoon. Right.
He concentrates. The spoon begins to bend just as the
Priestess touches his shoulder.
PRIESTESS
The Oracle will see you now.
Spoon Boy smiles.

INT. SHRINE (MATRIX) - DAY
Neo enters nervously. Beneath his feet is a path of the
zodiac leading to marbled stairs that rise to a dais and
a three-legged throne.
The throne is empty.
NEO
Hello?
A DISTANT FEMALE VOICE calls to him and he follows it up
the stairs. At the top of the dais, he smells something
cooking.
Following the scent, he moves behind the pillars where he
finds an open door.
VOICE (O.S.)
Just come on in.
He walks through a vestibule where he sees a fabulous
moonstone headdress and velvet robes. A second door
leads into --

INT. ORACLE'S CHAMBERS (MATRIX) - DAY
It looks like a suburban tract house.
There is a lot of cozy furniture, a dining roon hutch
filled with china, shelves and tables crowded with
doilies, knick-knacks and ceramic brick-a-brack.
Neo follows the plastic carpet runner to the kitchen.
A WOMAN is huddled beside the oven, peering inside
through the cracked door.
NEO
Hello?
ORACLE (WOMAN)
I know. You're Neo. Be right with you.
NEO
You're the Oracle?
ORACLE
Bingo. I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. It's really a
relief. All that pomp and circumstances just plain tucker me
out. Almost done. Smell good, don't they?
NEO
Yeah.
ORACLE
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway. And
don't worry about the vase.
NEO
What vase?
He turns to look around and his elbow knocks a VASE from
the table. It BREAKS against the linoleum floor.
ORACLE
The vase.
NEO
Shit, I'm sorry.
She pulls out a tray of chocolate chip cookies and turns.
She is an older woman, wearing big oven mitts,
comfortable slacks and a print blouse. She looks like
someone's grandma.
ORACLE
I said don't worry about it. I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
NEO
How did you know...?
She sets the cookie tray on a wooden hot-pad.
ORACLE
What's really going to bake your noodle later on is, would you
still have broken it if I hadn't said anything.
Smiling, she lights a cigarette.
ORACLE
You're cuter than I thought. I see why she likes you.
NEO
Who?
ORACLE
Not too bright, though.
She winks.
ORACLE
You know why Morpheus brought you to see me?
NEO
I think so.
ORACLE
So? What do you think? You think you're the one?
NEO
I don't know.
She gestures to a wooden plaque, the kind every grandma
has, except that the words are in Latin.
ORACLE
You know what that means? It's Latin. Means, 'Know thyself.'
She puts her cigarette down.
ORACLE
Well, let's have a look at you.
She widens his eyes, checks his ears, then feels the
glands in his neck.
ORACLE
Open your mouth. Say, 'ahhh.'
She nods then looks at his palms.
ORACLE
Hmmm. You sure got the gift, but it's tricky. I'd say the bad news
is, you're not the one. Still got a lot to learn. Maybe next life.
NEO
What's the good news?
ORACLE
Same as the bad news, you're not the one.
NEO
Is that it, then?
ORACLE
No. Here.
She picks up the tray of cooling cookies.
ORACLE
You better take a cookie. Got a big day ahead of you.
He eyes her, then takes a cookie.
ORACLE
Make a believer out of you yet.

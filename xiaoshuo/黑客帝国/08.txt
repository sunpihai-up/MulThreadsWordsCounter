INT. ROOM 1313
Across the room, a dark figure stares out the tall
windows veiled with decaying lace. He turns and his
smile lights up the room.
MORPHEUS
At last.
He wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible
behind circular mirrored glasses.
He strides to Neo and they shake hands.
MORPHEUS
Welcome, Neo. As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
NEO
It's an honor.
MORPHEUS
Please. Come. Sit.
He nods to Trinity.
MORPHEUS
Thank you, Trinity.
She bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an
adjacent room.
They sit across from one another in cracked, burgundy-
leather chairs.
MORPHEUS
I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling
down the rabbit hole?
NEO
You could say that.
MORPHEUS
I can see it in your eyes. You have the look of a man who accepts
what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.
A smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of his lips.
MORPHEUS
Ironically, this is not far from the truth. But I'm getting ahead
of myself. Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
NEO
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet
you.
MORPHEUS
Yes. Thank you. But I think we both know there's more to it than
that. Do you believe in fate, Neo?
NEO
No.
MORPHEUS
Why not?
NEO
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
MORPHEUS
I know exactly what you mean.
Again, that smile that could cut glass.
MORPHEUS
Let me tell you why you are here. You are here because you have the gift.
NEO
What gift?
MORPHEUS
I've watched you, Neo. You do not use a computer like a tool. You
use it like it was part of yourself. What you can do inside
a computer is not normal. I know. I've seen it. What you do is
magic.
Neo shrugs.
NEO
It's not magic.
MORPHEUS
But it is, Neo. It is. How else would you describe what has been
happening to you?
He leans forward.
MORPHEUS
We are trained in this world to accept only what is rational and
logical. Have you ever wondered why?
Neo shakes his head.
MORPHEUS
As children, we do not separate the possible from the impossible
which is why the younger a mind is the easier it is to free while a
mind like yours can be very difficult.
NEO
Free from what?
MORPHEUS
From the Matrix.
Neo locks at his eyes but only sees a reflection of himself.
MORPHEUS
Do you want to know what it is, Neo?
Neo swallows and nods his head.
MORPHEUS
It's that feeling you have had all your life. That feeling that
something was wrong with the world. You don't know what it is
but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad,
driving you to me. But what is it?
The LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back.
MORPHEUS
The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room.
You can see it out your window, or on your television. You feel it
when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes. It is
the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from
the truth.
NEO
What truth?
MORPHEUS
That you are a slave, Neo. That you, like everyone else, was born
into bondage...
... kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A
prison for your mind.
Outside, the WIND BATTERS a loose PANE of glass.
MORPHEUS
Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to
see it for yourself.
NEO
How?
MORPHEUS
Hold out your hands.
In Neo's right hand, Morpheus drops a red pill.
MORPHEUS
This is your last chance. After this, there is no going back.
In his left, a blue pill.
MORPHEUS
You take the blue pill and the story ends. You wake in your bed
and you believe whatever you want to believe.
The pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses.
MORPHEUS
You take the red pill and you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.
Neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, with the
moisture growing in his palms.
MORPHEUS
Remember that all I am offering is the truth. Nothing more.
Neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill. The
Cheshire smile returns.
MORPHEUS
Follow me.
He leads Neo into the other room, which is cramped with
high-tech equipment, glowing ash-bliie and electric green
from the racks of monitors.
Trinity, Apoc and Cypher look up as they enter.
CYPHER
Shit.
TRINITY
I knew he would.
Cypher saddles up to Morpheus, talking in a hushed tone
away from, Neo.
CYPHER
Morpheus, I know what you believe but I think this is a mistake.
We're rushing him. He's old. I'm afraid he might pop.
MORPHEUS
Haven't I always told you, Cypher, not to let fear control your life.
Apoc, are we on-line?
Neo recognizes the large man from the El train.
APOC
Almost.
He and Trinity are working quickly, hardwiring a complex
system of monitors, modules and drives.
NEO
Apoc? You wrote the Four Horsemen Virus.
APOC
That's right.
MORPHEUS
Neo, time is always against us. Will you take a seat there?
In the center of the room sits a chair. Near the chair
is an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked.
MORPHEUS
I imagine you know sonething about virtual reality.
Neo sits and Trinity begins gently fixing white electrode
disks to his head, arns, and the back of his neck.
NEO
A little.
MORPHEUS
Tell me about it.
NEO
Essentially, it's a hardware system that uses an apparatus;
headgear, gloves and whatever to make you feel that you are in a
computer program.
MORPHEUS
If the virtual reality apparatus, as you called it, was wired to all
of your senses and controlled them completely, would you be able to tell the difference between the virtual world and the real world?
NEO
You might not, no.
MORPHEUS
No, you wouldn't.
Neo whispers to Trinity.
NEO
You did all this?
She nods, placing a set of headphones over his ears.
They are wired to an old hotel phone.
MORPHEUS
The pill you took is part of a trace program. It's going to make
things feel a bit strange.
Distantly, through the ear phones, he hears Apoc POUNDING
on a KEYBOARD. Sweat beads his face. His eyes blink and
twitch when he notices the mirror.
Wide-eyed he stares as it begins to heal itself, a
webwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the
mirror were becoming liquid.
NEO
Shit...
Cypher works with Apoc checking reams of phosphorescent
data. Trinity monitors Neo's electric vital signs.
Neo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers
disappear beneath the rippling surface.
Quickly, he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror
stretches in long rubbery strands like mirrored-taffy
stuck to his fingertips.
NEO
What is this? Mescaline?
MORPHEUS
Just relax, Neo.
The strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away,
until the fragile wisps of mirror thread break.
With the TINKLING of GLASS, shimmering snowflakes
of electric-blinking mercury fall, hit the ground, and
fade.
He looks at his hand; fingers distended into mirrored
icicles that begin to melt rapidly, dripping, running
like wax down his fingers, spreading across his palms
where he sees his face reflected.
NEO
Uh-oh...
TRINITY
It's going into replication.
MORPHEUS
Apoc?
APOC
Still nothing.
Morpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number.
MORPHEUS
Tank, we're going to need the signal soon. Stay calm, Neo.
The mirror gel seems to come to life, racing, crawling up
his arns like hundreds of insects.
NEO
It's cold.
The mirror creeps up his neck as Neo begins to panic,
tipping his head as though he were sinking into the
mirror, trying to keep his mouth up.
NEO
It's all over me --
Morpheus is right next to him, with the phone.
TRINITY
I got a fibrillation!
CYPHER
I knew it, I knew it...
MORPHEUS
Shit! Apoc?
Streams of mercury run from Neo's nose.
APOC
Targeting... almost there.
An ALARM, on Trinity's monitor ERUPTS.
TRINITY
He's going into arrest!
CYPHER
He's gonna pop!
APOC
Lock! I got him!
MORPHEUS
Now, Tank now!
His eyes tear with mirror, rolling up and closing as a
high-pitched ELECTRIC SCREAM ERUPTS in the headphones --
It is a piercing SHRIEK like a computer calling to
another computer --
Neo's body arches in agony and we are pulled like we were
pulled into the holes of the phone
Sucked into his SCREAM and swallowed by darkness.

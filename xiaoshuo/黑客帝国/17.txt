INT. MAIN DECK
He walks over to Trinity's body, staring down at it
hanging in its coma-like stillness.
CYPHER
You know, for a long time, I
thought I was in love with you,
Trinity. I used to dream about
you...
He nuzzles his face against hers, feeling the softness of
it.
CYPHER
You are a beautiful woman. Too
bad things had to work out like
this.
We INTERCUT BETWEEN the appliance store and the main deck.
TRINITY
You killed them.
APOC
What?!
SWITCH
Oh God.
Wearing Tank's operator headgear, Cypher moves among the silent bodies.
CYPHER
In a way you're very lucky. Most
people never know why they die.
One minute they're alive, the next
they're dead. No warning.
Nothing. That's why I thought
maybe I should tell you. It
seemed the least I could do.
He stands over the body of Morpheus, as his anger boils up out of him.
CYPHER
You see, the truth, the real,truth
is that the war is over. It's
been over for a long time. And
guess what? We lost! Did you
hear that? We lost the war!
TRINITY
What about Zion?
CYPHER
Zion? Zion is a part of this
delusion. More of this madness.
That's why this has to be done.
It has to end. Now and forever.
She suddenly sees the entire dark plan.
TRINITY
Oh rny God. This is abzut Zion.
You gave them Morpheus for the
access codes to Zion.
Cypher walks away from Morpheus and bends down next to Apoc's body.
CYPHER
You see, Trinity, we humans have a
place in the future. But it's not
here. It's in the Matrix.
TRINITY
The Matrix isn't real!
CYPHER
Oh, I disagree, Trinity. I
disagree. I think the Matrix is
more real than this world. I
mean, all I do is pull a plug
here. But there, you watch a man
die.
He grabs hold of the cable in Apoc's neck, twists it and
yanks it out.
CYPHER
You tell me which is more real.
Apoc seems to go blind for an instant, a scream caught in his throat, his hands reaching for nothing, and then
falls dead. Switch screams.
CYPHER
Welcome to the real world, right?
He laughs.
TRINITY
Somehow, some way, you're going to
pay for this.
CYPHER
Pay for it? I'm not even going to
remember it. It'll be like it
never happened. The tree falling
in the forest. It doesn't make a
sound.
His hand slides around the neck of Switch as he takes
hold of her plug.
She suddenly feels her body severed from her mind as she is murdered.
TRINITY
Goddamn you, Cypher!
CYPHER
Don't hate me, Trinity. I'm justthe messenger. And right now I'm going to prove that the message is
true.
He stands over Neo.
CYPHER
If Morpheus was right, then
there's no way I can pull this
plug, is there?
She turns to Neo, eyes wide with fear, and he knows he is next.
CYPHER
If he is the One, then in the next
few seconds there has to be some
kind of miracle to stop me.
Because if he dies like the others
that means Morpheus was wrong.
How can he be the One if he's
dead?
He takes hold of the cord when --
She hears an EXPLOSION and a scream.
Cypher is on the ground, his left leg blown off at the
knee. He rolls over and finds Tank on the ground, and
the sights of the plasma rifle.
TANK
How's it feel, Cypher? Knowing
you're about to die?
NEO
It's Tank! He's alive.
Cypher lunges for Neo's plug just as Tank BLOWS his head off.

INT. APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY
They're both listening, trying to figure out what is
happening when the store PHONE starts to RING.
Trinity smiles, tears moistening her eyes as Neo throws his arms around her. For a moment, it looks as if they might kiss before Trinity lets go.
TRINITY
We should, we should hurry.
NEO
Yeah. Right.

INT. MAIN DECK
Trinity's eyes open, a sense of relief surging through
her at the sight of the ship. As Tank unplugs her, she
sees his charred wounds.
TRINITY
Tank, you're hurt.
TANK
I'll be all right.
TRINITY
Dozer?
Tank's face tightens.
TRINITY
I'm sorry, Tank.

EXT. NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY
A Japanese luxury hotel in downtown Chicago.
A military helicopter sets down on the roof. Heavily
armed Marines begin to deploy.
Agent Jones gets out of the helicopter, flanked by
columns of Marines. They open the roof access door
and enter the top-floor maintenance level of the hotel.

INT. TOP FLOOR (MATRIX) - DAY
They get in the elevator. At every door, at least two
Marines stop and post guard.

INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY
They exit the elevator and walk to the Presidential
suite; the final two Marines post guard.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY
Inside, he finds Agent Smith.
AGENT JONES
There is a problem. Reagan has
failed to secure the hardware.
Agent Smith stares out the window.
AGENT SMITH
Never send a human to do a
machine's job.
AGENT JONES
But if Reagan has failed, why
haven't they pulled the plug?
AGENT SMITH
Haven't you learned by now, that
it is impossible to understand why
they do the things they do?
He turns.
AGENT SMITH
Continue as planned. Trace his
signal to locate their position
and deploy an extermination unit.
Morpheus is handcuffed to a chair, stripped to the waist. He is bleeding from numerous wounds and is pumped full of serum, alternately shivering and sweating. He is hooked up to various monitors with white disk electrodes.
Agent Brown begins running a trace program.

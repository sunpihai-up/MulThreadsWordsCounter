INT. MAIN DECK
His eyes snap open and he thrashes against the chair,
trying to rip the cable from the back of his neck.
NEO
Get this thing out of me!
TRINITY
Easy, Neo. Easy.
Dozer holds him while Trinity unlocks it. Once it's out,
he tears away from them, falling as he trips free of the
harness.
NEO
Don't touch me! Get away from me!
On his hands and knees, he reels as the world spins.
Sweat pours off him as a pressure builds inside his skull
as if his brian had been put into a centrifuge.
CYPHER
He's going to pop!
Vomiting violently, Neo pitches forward and blacks out.

INT. NEO'S ROOM
He blinks, regaining consciousness. The room is dark.
Neo is stretched out on his bed.
NEO
I can't go back, can I?
Morpheus sitting like a shadow on a chair in the far
corner.
MORPHEUS
No. But if you could, would you really want to?
Neo isn't sure of that answer.
MORPHEUS
I feel that I owe you an apology. There is a rule that we do not
free a mind once it reaches a certain age. It is dangerous.
They have trouble letting go.. Their mind turns against them.
I've seen it happen. I broke the rule because I had to.
He stares into the darkness, confessing as much to
himself as Neo.
MORPHEUS
When the Matrix was first built there was a man born inside that
had the ability to change what he wanted, to remake the Matrix as he saw fit. It was this man that freed the first of us and taught
us the secret of the war; control the Matrix and you control the
future.
He pauses.
MORPHEUS
When he died, the Oracle at the temple of Zion prophesied his
return and envisioned an end to the war and freedom for our
people. That is why there are those of us that have spent our
entire lives searching the Matrix, looking for him.
Neo can feel his eyes on him.
MORPHEUS
I did what I did, because I believe we have been brought here
for a reason, Neo. You are here to serve a purpose, just as I am
here to serve mine.
NEO
I told you I don't believe in fate.
Morpheus smiles, leaning towards hin.
MORPHEUS
But I do, Neo. I do.
He stands up.
MORPHEUS
Get some rest. You're going to need it.
NEO
For what?
MORPHEUS
Your training.
INT. HOVERCRAFT
There is no morning; there is only darkness and then the
fluorescent light sticks flicker on.

INT. NEO'S ROOM
Neo is awake in his bed, staring up at the lights. The
door opens and TA.NK steps inside.
TANK
Morning. Did you sleep?
NEO
No.
TANK
You will tonight. I guarantee it. I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.
He offers his hand and Neo shakes it. He notices that Tank doesn't have any jacks.
NEO
You don't have...
TANK
Any holes? Nope. Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent
pure, old fashioned, home-grown human. Born free. Right here in
the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
NEO
Zion?
TANK
Zion is the place, man. You'll see it one day. Last human city.
All we got left.
Tank smiles.
TANK
Goddamn, I got to tell you I'm fairly excited to see what you are
capable of. I mean if Morpheus is right and all. We're not supposed
to talk.about any of that, but if you are, well then this is an
exciting time. We got a lot to do so let's get to it.

INT. MAIN DECK
Neo is plugged in, hanging in one of the suspension chairs.
TANK
We're supposed to load all these operations programs first, but
this is some major boring shit. Why don't we start something a
little fun?
Tank smiles as he plops into his operator's chair. He begins flipping through a tall carousel loaded with micro discs.
TANK
How about sore combat training?
Neo reads the label on the disk.
NEO
Jiujitsu? I'm going to learn jujitsu?
Tank slides the disk into Neo's supplement drive.
NEO
No way.
Smiling, Tank punches the "load" code.
His body jumps against the harness as his eyes clamp
shut. The monitors kick wildly as his heart pounds,
adrenaline surges, and his brain sizzles.
An instant later his eyes snap open.
NEO
Holy shit!
TANK
Hey, Mikey, he likes it! Ready for more?
NEO
Hell yes!

INT. MAIN DECK - CLOSE ON COMPUTER MONITOR - LATER
as grey pixels slowly fill a small, half-empty box. It
is a meter displaying how much download time is left.
The title bar reads: "Combat Series 10 of 12," file
categories flashing beneath it: Savate, Jujitsu, Ken Po,
Drunken Boxing...
Morpheus walks in.
MORPHEUS
How is he?
Tank looks at his watch, rubs his eyes.
TANK
Ten hours straight. He's a machine.
Neo's body spasms and relaxes as his eyes open, breath
hissing from his lips. He looks like he just orgasmed.
He locks at Morpheus.
NEO
This is incredible. I know Kung Fu.
Morpheus sits in the drive chair next to hin. He nods to Tank.
MORPHEUS
Show me.

INT. DOJO
They are standing in a very sparse japanese-style dojo.
MORPHEUS
This is a sparring program, similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix. Consider this your first lesson.
He assumes a fighting stance.
MORPHEUS
Attack me.
Neo assumes a similar stance, cautiously circling until
he gives a short cry and launches a furious attack.
It is like a Jackie Chan movie at high speed, fists and
feet striking from every angle as Neo presses his attack
--
But each and every blow is blocked by effortless speed.

INT. MAIN DECK
While their minds battle in the programmed reality, the
two bodies appear quite serene, suspended in the drive
chairs.
Tank monitors their life systems noticing that Neo is
wildly and chaotically lit up as opposed to the slow and
steady rhythm of Morpheus.

INT. MESS HALL
Dinner is up. Everyone is eating bowls of single-cell
protein. It has a cottage cheese consistency.
MOUSE bursts in the room.
MOUSE
Morpheus is fighting Neo!
All at once they bolt for the door.

INT. DOJO
Neo's face is knotted, teeth clenched, as he hurls
himself at Morpheus.
MORPHEUS
Good. Adaption. Improvisation. But your weakness isn't your
technique.
Morpheus attacks him and it is like nothing we have seen.
His feet and fists are everywhere taking Neo apart. For
every blow Neo blocks, five more hit their marks until --
Neo falls.
Panting, on his hands and knees, blood spits fror, his
mouth speckling the white floor of the Dojo.
MORPHEUS
How did I beat you?
NEO
You -- You're too fast.
MORPHEUS
Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with
my muscles in this place?
Neo is frustrated, still unable to catch his breath.
MORPHEUS
Do you believe that's air you are breathing now?
Neo squints at him.
MORPHEUS
If you can free your mind, the body will follow.
Neo stands, nodding.
MORPHEUS
Again.
Their fists fly with pneumatic speed.

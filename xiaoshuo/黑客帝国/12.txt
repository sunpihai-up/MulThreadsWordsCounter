INT. MAIN DECK
Everyone is gathered behind Tank, watching the fight,
like watching a game of Mortal Combat.
CABLE
Jeezus Keerist! That boy is fast!
MOUSE
You ever seen anyone that fast that soon, Tank?
TANK
Never.
APOC
Morpheus is right. He's got to be the one.

INT. DOJO
The speed of the blows rises like a drum solo that seems
impossible to sustain. Neo's face sheds its mask of calm
with a scream.
He wants to beat Morpheus bad.
Finally a single blow catches Morpheus on the side of the
head, knocking his glasses off.

INT. MAIN DECK
There are several gasps.
MOUSE
I don't believe it!

INT. DOJO
Morpheus rubs his face.
MORPHEUS
You are angry with me.
Neo pants.
NEO
I, uh... maybe.
MORPHEUS
It's all right. It's natural.
NEO
I feel better.
MORPHEUS
Good, good. Anger is a gift, Neo, but it's a heavy one.
Morpheus smiles.
MORPHEUS
Tank, load the jump program.
Neo straightens as the dojo DISSOLVES away like a curtain
lifting, leaving the two men now standing on a building
rooftop in a city skyline.
MORPHEUS
You have to learn to let go of that anger. You must let go of
everything.
A WIND HOWLS, whipping Morpheus' long coat to the side.
MORPHEUS
You must empty yourself to free your mind.
Morpheus spins, running hard at the edge of the rooftop.
And jumps. He sails through the air, his coat billowing
out behind him like a cape --
Somersaults once and lands on the rooftop across the street.
NEO
Shit.
Neo looks down at the street twenty floors below, then at
Morpheus an impossible fifty feet away.
NEO
Okie dokie.
He takes a deep breath.
NEO
Yeah. Free my mind. Right. No problem.
He concentrates. Runs.

INT. MAIN DECK
They are transfixed.
CABLE
He's gonna make it.
APOC
No way. Not possible.
MOUSE
No one's ever made their first jump.
SWITCH
What if he does?
APOC
He won't.
TANK
It's never been done.
Trinity stares at the screen, her fists clenching as she whispers.
TRINITY
Come on.

EXT. ROOFTOP
Summoning every ounce of strength in his legs, Neo
launches himself into the air in a single maniacal shriek
--
But comes up drastically short.
His eyes widen as he plummets. Stories fly by, the
ground rushing up at him, but as he hits --
The ground gives way, stretchinp like a trapeze net.
He bounces and flips, slowly coming to a rest, flat on
his back.
He laughs, a bit unsure, wiping the wind-blown tears from
his face.
Morpheus exits the building and helps him to his feet.
MORPHEUS
Everyone falls the first time.
Neo nods quietly.
MORPHEUS
If you never know failure, how can you know success?

INT. MAIN DECK
They break up.
MOUSE
What does it mean?
CABLE
It doesn't mean anything.
CYPHER
Everyone falls, right, Trinity?
But Trinity has left.
Neo's eyes open as Tank eases the plug out. He tries to
move and groans, cradling his ribs.
While Tank helps Morpheus, Neo spits blood into his hand.
NEO
I thought it wasn't real.
Neo stares at the blood.
NEO
If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?
MORPHEUS
The body cannot live without the mind.

INT. NEO'S ROOM
Trinity enters from the hall, carrying a try of food.
TRINITY
Neo, I saved you some dinner --
She sees him passed out on the bed. She sets the tray
down and pulls the blanket over him.
She pauses, her face close to his, then inhales lightly,
breathing in the scent of him, before slowly pulling away.
It seems the moment she closes the door, he wakes with a
start, unsure of where he is. After a moment, he gets
out of bed.

INT. HALL
The ship is quiet and dark. Everyone is asleep.

INT. MAIN DECK
The core glows with monitor light. Cypher is in the
operator's chair as Neo cones up behind him.
CYPHER
Whoa! Shit, Neo, you scared the bejeezus out of ne.
NEO
Sorry.
CYPHER
No, it's all right.
NEO
What are you doing?
CYPHER
Midnight watch.
Neo's eyes light up as he steps closer to the screens
that seem alive with a constant flow of data.
NEO
Is that... ?
CYPHER
The Matrix? Yeah.
The monitors are packed with bizarre codes and equations.
CYPHER
You want a drink?
He pours Neo a drink from a large plastic jug.
CYPHER
I'll tell you, I feel for you, man. I really do. Most of us
were still young, just punks, when Morpheus jacked us. But you, you had a real life.
Neo takes a sip and it almost kills him. Cypher pounds on his back.
CYPHER
Good shit, huh? Dozer makes it. It's good for two things:
degreasing engines and killing brain cells.
Red-faced, Neo finally stops coughing.
CYPHER
Did he tell you why he did it?
Neo nods.
CYPHER,
I'll be the didn't tell you that this wasn't the first time he
thought he found the One.
Neo shakes his head as Cypher fills his cup and laughs.
CYPHER
Let me give you a piece of advice. Between you and me, if Morpheus says you can fly, I wouldn't go jumping out any windows to find out if he's right. Understand?
Cypher raises his drink. Neo swallows another throat-
scorching mouthful.
CYPHER
Welcome to the real world!

INT. RESTAURANT (MATRIX) - NIGHT
CHAMBER MUSIC and the ambiance of wealth soak the room as
we watch a serrated knife saw through a thick, gorgeous steak.
CYPHER
That's what he said to me nine years ago.
The meat is so perfect, charred on the outside, oozing
red juice from the inside, that it could be a dream.
CYPHER
The real world. Ha, what a joke.
We recognize the grating voice, the insidious laugh.
CYPHER
You know what real is? I'll tell you what real is.
A fork stabs the cube of meat and we FOLLOW it UP TO the
face of Cypher.
CYPHER
Real is just another four-letter word.
He laughs, shoving the steak into his mouth.
The restaurant is located on the top floor of a Chicago skyscraper where the view is breathtaking and the menu has no prices.
Sitting across from Cypher is Agent Smith.
AGENT SMITH
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?
Cypher chews the steak loudly, smacking it between his
teeth.
CYPHER
Mmm, so, so fucking good.
Smith watches him shovel another hunk of meat into his mouth.
CYPHER
You know, I know that this steak doesn't exist. I know when I put
it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy
and delicious. After nine years, do you know what I've realized?
Pausing, he examines the meat skewered on his fork. He
pops it in, eyes rolling up, savoring the tender beef melting in his mouth.
CYPHER
Ignorance is bliss.
AGENT SMITH
Then we have a deal?
CYPHER
I don't want to remember nothing. Nothing! You understand? And I
want to be rich. Someone important. Like an actor. You can do that, right?
AGENT SMITH
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.
Cypher takes a deep drink of wine.
CYPHER
All right. You get my body back in a power plant, reinsert me into
the Matrix and I'll get you what you want.
AGENT SMITH
Access codes to Zion.
CYPHER
I told you, I don't know them. But I can give you the man who
does.
AGENT SMITH
Morpheus.

INT. MAIN DECK
Sweat dapples his lip as Neo snaps out of the construct coma.
NEO
Jeez, I was wondering about that.
TANK
What?
NEO
Why I was bald here but not in the
Matrix.
TANK
R.S.I.
NEO
Residual self image.
TANK
Good. Now what's this?
He points to one of Neo's monitors.
NEO
Life systems monitor, glucose levels.
TANK
What's that?
NEO
Main power supply to the core.
He follows Tank to the operator's station where he points
to a red key-switch.
TANK
How about this?
NEO
Mainframe self-destruct. Uses all remaining power to generate an...
E.M.P?
TANK
Electromagnetic pulse. Our best weapon against the machines. The
problem is if someone is still in the Matrix when that thing goes
off, they're not coming back.
Neo nods as Morpheus comes up behind them.
MORPHEUS
How's he doing?
TANK
We just finished the operation programs and he's showing great
retention.
MORPHEUS
Good. I want everyone alerted to 12-hour stand-by. We're going in.
Neo, it's time for you to know why you're here.
Morpheus walks away.
NEO
What's he talking about?
TANK
He's taking you into the Matrix to see her.
NEO
See who?
TANK
The Oracle.
Neo looks down at the monitor teeming with Matrix data
that seems to coalesce, equations giving way to images as
a METAL SCREAM RISES BECOMING --

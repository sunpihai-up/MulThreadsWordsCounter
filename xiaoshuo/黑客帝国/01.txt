April 8, 1996
FADE IN ON:
COMPUTER SCREEN
So close it has no boundaries.
A blinking cursor pulses in the electric darkness like a
heart coursing with phosphorous light, burning beneath
the derma of black-neon glass.
A PHONE begins to RING, we hear it as though we were
making the call. The cursor continues to throb,
relentlessly patient, until --
MAN (V.O.)
Hello?
Data now slashes across the screen, information flashing
faster than we read.
SCREEN
Call trans opt: received.
2-19-96 13:24:18 REC:Log>
WOMAN (V.O.)
I'm inside. Anything to report?
We listen to the phone conversation as though we were on
a third line. The man's name is CYPHER. The woman,
TRINITY.
CYPHER (V.O.)
Let's see. Target left work at 5:01 PM.
SCREEN
Trace program: running.
The entire screen fills with racing columns of numbers.
Shimmering like green-electric rivets, they rush at a 10-
digit phone number in the top corner.
CYPHER (V.O.)
He caught the northbound Howard line. Got off at Sheridan.
Stopped at 7-11. Purchased six- pack of beer and a box of Captain
Crunch. Returned home.
The area code is identified. The first three numbers
suddenly fixed, leaving only seven flowing columns.
We begin MOVING TOWARD the screen, CLOSING IN as each
digit is matched, one by one, snapping into place like
the wheels of a slot machine.
TRINITY (V.O.)
All right, you're relieved. Use the usual exit.
CYPHER (V.O.)
Do you know when we're going to make contact?
TRINITY
Soon.
Only two thin digits left.
CYPHER (V.O.)
Just between you and me, you don't believe it, do you? You don't
believe this guy is the one?
TRINITY (V.O.)
I think Morpheus believes he is.
CYPHER (V.O.)
I know. But what about you?
TRINITY (V.O.)
I think Morpheus knows things that I don't.
CYPHER (V.O.)
Yeah, but if he's wrong --
The final number pops into place --
TRINITY (V.O.)
Did you hear that?
CYPHER (V.O.)
Hear what?
SCREEN
Trace complete. Call origin:
#312-555-0690
TRINITY (V.O.)
Are you sure this line is clean?
CYPHER (V.O.)
Yeah, course I'm sure.
We MOVE STILL CLOSER, the ELECTRIC HUM of the green
numbers GROWING INTO an OMINOUS ROAR.
TRINITY (V.O.)
I better go.
CYPHER (V.O.)
Yeah. Right. See you on the other side.
She hangs up as we PASS THROUGH the numbers, entering the
netherworld of the computer screen.
Where gradually the sound of a police radio grows around
us.
RADIO (V.O.)
Attention all units. Attention all units.
Suddenly, a flashlight cuts open the darkness and we find
ourselves in --

INT. CHASE HOTEL - NIGHT
The hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way
across the polyester carpeting, destroying several rooms
as it spooled soot up the walls and ceiling leaving
patterns of permanent shadow.
We FOLLOW four armed POLICE officers using flashlights as
they creep down the blackened hall and ready themselves
on either side of room 303.
The biggest of them violently kicks in the door --
The other cops pour in behind him, guns thrust before
them.
BIG COP
Police! Freeze!
The room is almost devoid of furniture. There is a fold-
up table and chair with a phone, a modern, and a powerbook
computer. The only light in the room is the glow of the
computer.
Sitting there, her hands still on the keyboard, is
TRINITY; a woman in black leather.
BIG COP
Get your hands behind your head!
Trinity rises.
BIG COP
Hands behind your head! Now! Do it!
She slowly puts her hands behind her head.

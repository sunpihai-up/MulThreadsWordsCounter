EXT. STREET
A police officer unlocks a yellow metal boot from the
wheel of an enormous oldsmobile.

INT. NEO'S APARTMENT
They watch from the window as the cops, silently,
robotically, climb into their van.
ANTHONY
Look at 'em. Automatons. Don't think about what they're- doing or
why. Computer tells 'em what to do and they do it.FRIEND #l
Thc banality of evil.
He slaps the money in Neo's hand.

ANTHONY
Thanks, neighbor.
DUJOUR
Why don't you come to the party with us?
NEO
I don't know. I have to work tomorrow.
DUJOUR
Come on. It'll be fun.
He looks up at her and suddenly notices on her black
leather motorcycle jacket dozens of pins: bands,
symbols, slogans, military medals and --
A small white rabbit.
The ROOM TILTS.
NEO
Yeah, yeah. Sure, I'll go.

INT. APARTMENT
An older Chicago apartment; a series of halls connects a
chain of small high-ceilinged rooms lined with heavy
casements.
Smoke hangs like a veil, blurring the few lights there are.
Dressed predominantly in black, people are everywhere,
gathered in cliques around pieces of furniture like
jungle cats around a tree.
Neo stands against a wall, alone, sipping from a bottle
of beer, feeling completely out of place, he is about to
leave when he notices a woman staring at him.
The woman is Trinity. She walks straight up to him.
In the nearest room, shadow-like figures grind against
each other to the pneumatic beat of INDUSTRIAL MUSIC.
TRINITY
Hello, Neo.
NEO
How did you know that --
TRINITY
I know a lot about you. I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
NEO
Who are you?
TRINITY
My name is Trinity.
NEO
Trinity? The Trinity? The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S.
Kansas City D-Base?
TRINITY
That was a long time ago.
NEO
Gee-zus.
TRINITY
What?
NEO
I just thought... you were a guy.
TRINITY
Most guys do.
Neo is a little embarrassed.
NEO
Do you want to go sorewhere and
talk?
TRINITY
No. It's safe here and I don't have much time.
The MUSIC is so loud they must stand very close, talking
directly into each other's ear.
NEO
That was you on the board tonight. That was your note, wasn't it?
TRINITY
I had to gamble that you would see and they wouldn't.
NEO
Who wouldn't?
TRINITY
I can't explain everything to you. I'm sure that it's all going to
seem very strange, but I brought you here to warn you, Neo. You
are in a lot of danger.
NEO
What? Why?
TRINITY
They're watching you. Something happened and they found out about you. Normally, if our target is exposed we let it go. But this
time, we can't do that.
NEO
I don't understand --
TRINITY
You came here because you wanted to know the answer to a hacker's question.
NEO
The Matrix. What is the Matrix?
TRINITY
Twelve years ago I met a man, a great man, who said that no one
could be told the answer to that question. That they had to see
it, to believe it.
Her body is against his; her lips very close to his ear.
TRINITY
He told me that no one should look for the answer unless they have to because once you see it, everything changes. Your life and
the world you live in will never be the same. It's as if you wake
up one morning and the sky is falling.
There is a hypnotic quality to her voice and Neo feels
the words like a drug, seeping into him.
TRINITY
The truth is out there, Neo. It's looking for you and it will find
you, if you want it to.
She takes hold of him with her eyes.
TRINITY
That's all I can tell you right now. Good-bye, Neo. And good
luck.
NEO
Wait. Who was it? Who was the
man?
She leans close, her lips alrost touching his ear as she
whispers.
TRINITY
You know who.
She turns and he watches her melt into the shifting wall of bodies.
A SOUND RISES steadily, growing out of the music,
pressing in on Neo until it is all he can hear as we --
CUT TO:

INT. NEO'S APARTMENT
The sound is an ALARM CLOCK, slowly dragging Neo to
consciousness. He strains to read the clock face:
9:15 A.M.
NEO
Shitshitshit.

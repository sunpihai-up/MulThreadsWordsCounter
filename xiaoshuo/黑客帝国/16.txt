EXT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY
Cuff ed and beaten, Morpheus is thrown into a caged
transport vehicle. The DOOR CLANGS shut.
Agent Jones finds Agent Smith.
AGENT JONES
The others were lost.
AGENT SMITH
You've taken care of Reagan?
Agent Jones nods.
AGENT SMITH
Then the others do not matter.

EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
A manhole cover cracks open. Two eyes peek out just as a
TRUCK RATTLES over it. The THUNDER DOPPLERS AWAY and the cover opens.
Neo, Trinity, Switch and Apoc climb out. Trinity pulls a
water-logged phone from her pocket.
TRINITY
We need a phone.

INT. MAIN DECK
Tank is again at the monitors, searching the Matrix.
TANK
We gotta find the others. They're still alive.
The PHONE RINGS.
TANK
Operator.
CYPHER (V.O.)
I need an exit! Fast!
TANK
Cypher? I thought they had you?

EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
Cypher is standing at a public phone. Across the street
is the burning paddy wagon that appears to have collided
witli an oncoming car.
CYPHER
There was an accident. A fucking
car accident. All of a sudden.
Boom. They're all dead. I still
got the shakes but, Jesus,
someone's going to make a believer
out of me.

INT. MAIN DECK
Dozer spots the wreck.
DOZER
There he is.
TANK
I got you.
CYPHER (V.O.)
Just get me outta here.

EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
TANK (V.O.)
Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie.
An old appliance store.
Cypher hangs up and smiles as the fire trucks arrive.
CYPHER
An actor. Definitely.

INT. MAIN DECK
The PHONE RINGS. Tank answers.
TANK
Operator.
TRINITY (V.O.)
Tank, it's me.

EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
They are outside a pawn shop. Trinity has a new cellular.
TRINITY
We need an exit!
TANK (V.O.)
Gotcha. You're not far from Cypher.
TRINITY
Cypher, I thought --
TANK (V.O.)
So did we. That boy's got nine lives. I sent him to Franklin and
Erie.
TRINITY
Got it.
She hangs up.

EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
Running, Cypher turns onto Erie.

INT. APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY
Dead machines, eviscerated and shrouded with dust lay on
metal shelves like bodies in a morgue.
Plywood covering a small window is ripped off and Cypher
crawls inside.
Deep in the back room, a PHONE that has not rung in years
begins to RING.

INT. MAIN DECK
Tank punches the emit command.
TANK
Got him.
Cypher's body twitches in its harness, jerking itself
awake. His eyes blink open. Dozer unplugs him.
DOZER
System check looks fine.
Cypher stands, a raspy cough spewing from his lungs.

EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
Trinity sees the appliance shop.

INT. MAIN DECK
Cypher holds his chest.
DOZER
You okay?
CYPHER
Goddamn gas. My lungs are killing
me.
He crosses to an overhead bin.
CYPHER
We got any pain killers?
DOZER
The first aid kit's over here.
As Dozer stoops for a cabinet, Cypher pulls back a heavy
blanket exposing a plasma rifle.

INT. APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY
Neo crawls through the window that Cypher opened.

INT. MAIN DECK
Tank finishes loading the exit programs as Cypher rises
behind him, swinging the weapon at his back.
He looks over as Dozer turns with the first aid kit, a
look of frozen disbelief crossing his face --
DOZER
No!
Tank spins as red hot wads of PLASMA EXPLODE through his
chair and into his back. Diving, a second BURST tears up
his side --
As Dozer shoots a look at the monitor where Tank was
working. He stabs the enter command activating the exit
sequence and ducks under a BARRAGE of PLASMA FIRE-

INT. APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY
The PHONE begins to RING as the others crawl in.
SWITCH
God, I love that sound.

INT. MAIN DECK
Dozer rolls up, grabbing a heavy crowbar from a box of
tools.
Cypher circles the drive chairs as the sights of the
plasma rifle find Dozer's face.
Dozer charges, screaming, and the PLASMA RIFLE SCREAMS
back.

INT. APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY
The PHONE is still RINGING.
TRINITY
You first,.Neo.
Neo answers the phone when there is a CLICK. There is no
signal. Nothing but silence.
TRINITY
What happened?
NEO
I don't know. It just went dead.
Trinity listens to the dead line and takes out the
cellular.

INT. MAIN DECK
The operator PHONE begins to RING- Cypher steps over the
body of Tank and looks at the monitor.

INT. APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY
Trinity can almost feel him watching them. Every
unanswered RING wrings her gut a little tighter, until --
CYPHER (V.O.)
Hello, Trinity.
TRINITY
Cypher? Where's Tank?
CYPHER (V.O.)
He had an accident.
TRINITY
An accident? What about Dozer?
Is Dozer there?

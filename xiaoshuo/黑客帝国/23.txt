EXT. CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
Three figures silhouette by the burning wreckage become
the three agents.
Further down the street, Neo hauls his broken, bleeding
ass.
Agents Brown and Smith slow, touching their ear-pieces as
Agent Jones continues chasing full-bore.
Neo spins around a corner, racing toward a hotel called:
the Heart of Chicago Hotel.
Only Agent Jones is behind him now.
Neo dives into the alley. At the far end he sees Agent
Brown charging. Neo leaps for the fire escape and begins
to climb.

INT. SEWER MAIN
Sentinels open and shift like killer kaleidoscopes as
they ready their weapons, swarming around the
Nebuchadnezzar.

INT. HOVERCRAFT
The hovercraft booms as machines drop onto it.
TANK
I'm going to make the call.
MORPHEUS
Do it!

INT. "HEART OF CHICAGO" HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY
Agent Snith is in the elevator when he hears the DISTANT
RING of a PHONE.

EXT. ALLEY (MATRIX) - DAY
The agents chase him, FIRING, BULLETS SPARKING and
RICOCHETING even as Neo jumps for the third-floor
platform.
Neo kicks in the window, jumping into the hall. The
doors count backwards: 310... 309...

INT. HOVERCRAFT
Morpheus grabs the biggest gun he can find. The lasers
begin to slice through the hull.
TRINITY
Where is he?
TANK
Almost there.
MORPHEUS
He's going to make it.
TRINITY
Hurry, Neo.

INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY
Neo can hear the PHONE RINGING.
305... 304...
Agent Brown reaches the broken window behind him just as
Neo grabs the handle of 303, throwing open the door to
find --
Agent Sniith, waiting, .45 cocked.
Neo can't move -- can't think --
BOOM.

INT. HOVERCRAFT
Neo's body jerks, and everyone hears it as the life
monitors snap flat-line.
Trinity screams. Morpheus is frozen in disbelief.

INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY
Three holes in his chest, Neo falls to the blue shag
carpeting, blood smearing down the wallpaper.
Agent Smith stands over him, still aiming, taking no
chances.
AGENT SMITH
Check him.

INT. HOVERCRAFT
Through the lasered opening, Morpheus screams, blasting
away at the machines; comet-wads of plasma burning holes
in their armored housings.
Trinity collapses onto Neo's body.
TRINITY
No-no-no! Neo, you're not dead!
You can't be dead!

INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY
Kneeling beside him, Agent Brown checks his vital signs.
AGENT BROWN
He's gone.
Agent Smith smiles, standing over him.
AGENT SMITH
I told you, you couldn't win.

INT. HOVERCRAFT
Tank is hit, a laser bolt knocking him to the ground.
They can't hold them off any longer. Morpheus lunges for
the self destruct --
As Trinity whispers in Neo's ear.
TRINITY
You're right here. I'm holding you, Neo. I'm not letting you go.
Do you hear me? I won't let you go.

INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY
The agents walk to the elevator, leaving Neo's body
behind.

INT. HOVERCRAFT
Morpheus flicks the Plexiglas shield of the self-
destruct.
TRINITY
Goddamnit, Neo! Don't give it up!
Not now!
She pounds on his chest.
TRINITY
Not now!

INT. HOTEL HALL (MATRIX) - DAY
The BLOW ECHOES deep in his mind.
His eyes snap open.

INT. HOVERCRAFT
Trinity screams as the monitors jump back to life. Tank
and Morpheus stare, unbelieving.
It is a miracle.
TRINITY
Now get up!

INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY
Neo struggles, holding his chest, sitting up. Down the
hall, he sees the elevator closing and --
Agent Smith staring at him as if he were looking at a
Cypher.
Neo gives him the finger.
AGENT SMITH
Nooooo!
Agent Smith pounds on the elevator door.

INT. HOVERCRAFT
A sentinel BLOWS a hole in Morpheus' right arm and he
screams, refusing to let go of the detonator.
INT. ROOM 303 (MATRIX) - DAY
Neo dives for the RINGING PHONE.

INT. HOVERCRAFT
Machines split open the craft, pouring in, lasers
targeting everywhere.
A beat finds the center of Morpheus' forehead and he
screams, ready to die.
TRINITY
Now!
He turns the key.

INT. OVERFLOW PIT
A blinding shock of white lights flood the chamber;
sentinels blink and fall instantly dead, filling the pit
with their cold, metal carcasses.

INT. HOVERCRAFT
In the still darkness, only the humans are alive.
TRINITY
Neo?
His eyes open. Tears pour from her smiling eyes as he
reaches up to touch her.
And she kisses hin; it seems like it might last forever.
FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:
ON COMPUTER SCREEN
as in the opening. The cursor beating steadily, waiting.
A PHONE begins to RING.
It is answered and the screen fills instantly with the
trace program. After a long beat, we recognize Neo's
voice.
NEO (V.O.)
Hi. It's me. I know you're out there. I know you're working as
fast as you can to catch me.
We CLOSE IN ON the racing columns of numbers shimmering
across the screen.
NEO (V.O.)
I thought I should call and let you know how things stand.
We DIVE THROUGH the numbers, surging UP THROUGH the
darkness, sucked TOWARDS a tight constellation of stars.
NEO (V.O.)
I know you're real proud of this world you've built, the way it
works, all the nice little rules and such, but I've got some bad
news.
We realize that the constellation is actually the holes
in the mouthpiece of a phone. Seen from inside.
NEO (V.O.)
I've decided to make a few
changes.
We SHOOT THROUGH the holes as Neo hangs up the phone.
He steps out of the phone booth and starts walking,
wearing a long black coat and dark glasses. He passes a
mother dragging her little BOY, who cranes his neck as --
Neo takes off, flying up into the air.
BOY
Mommy! Mommy!
MOMMY
What?
BOY
That man! That man flies!
MOMMY
Don't be silly, honey. Men don't fly.
There is a RUSH of AIR as the Boy stares up as Neo shoots
overhead. His coat billowing like a black leather cape
as he soars up, up, and away.
FADE OUT.
THE END

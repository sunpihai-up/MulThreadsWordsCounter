INT. MAIN DECK
Neo looks at Morpheus whose body is covered with a cold sweat.
NEO
What are they doing to him?
TANK
They're cracking his mind.
NEO
How?
TANK
They inject virus-like serums to break down the system. It's like
cracking a computer. All it takes is time.
NEO
How much time?
TANK
Depends on the mind. But eventually, it will crack and his
alpha pattern will change from this to this.
Tank punches several commands on Morpheus' personal unit.
The monitor waves change from a chaotic pattern to an orderly symmetrical one.
TANK
When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
NEO
The access codes to Zion.
TANK
If an agent got inside Zion's mainframe he could do anything.
Disable the defense system. It would be the end of us.
He looks up at Trinity who is pacing relentlessly.
TANK
We can't let that happen. We have to do it, Trinity. Zion has to be
protected.
Trinity sees Cypher's dead body. Rage overtakes her and she starts kicking hin.
TRINITY
Goddamnit! Goddamnit!
TANK
We have to pull the plug.
TRINITY
No!
TANK
We don't have any other choice.
Those words are like using gasoline to put out a fire and we watch the pain in her eyes burn into a blaze. She walks past him and gets into her chair.
TANK
Trinity, what are you doing?
TRINITY
I'm going in after him.
TANK
Morpheus could conform at any minute --
TRINITY
If he does I'm sure you'll do what has to be done.
TANK
You saw that place. It's suicide.
She glares at him.
TANK
I know what Morpheus means to you --
TRINITY
No. No, I don't think you do. If you did, then you would know that
I'm not letting him go. Not without a fight, Tank.She yanks her harness tight.
TRINITY
Not without a fight.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY
Agent Smith stands in the bedroon of the enormous suite, staring out the windows at the city, below, shimmering with brilliant sunlight.
AGENT SMITH
Have you ever stood and stared at it, Morpheus? Marveled at its
beauty. Its genius. Billions of people just living out their
lives... oblivious.
Agent Brown sucks a serum from a glass vial, filling a
hypodermic needle.
AGENT SMITH
Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world? Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy. It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost.
Agent Brown jams the needle into Morpheus' shoulder, and plunges down.
AGENT SMITH
Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe
your perfect world. But I believe that, as a species, human beings
define their reality through suffering and misery.
Agent Brown studies the screens as the life signs react
violently to the injection.
AGENT SMITH
The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept
trying to wake up from. Which is why the Matrix was re-designed to
this: the peak of your civilization.
He turns from the window.
AGENT SMITH
I say 'your civilization' because as soon as we start thinking for
you, it really becomes our civilization, which is, of course,
what this is all about.
He sits down directly in front of Morpheus.
AGENT SMITH
Evolution, Morpheus. Evolution.
He lifts Morpheus' head.
AGENT SMITH
Like the dinosaur. Look out that window. You had your time.
Morpheus stares hard at him, trying hard not to show the pain racking his mind.
AGENT SMITH
The future is our world, Morpheus.
The future is our time.

INT. MAIN DECK
Neo goes to his chair and begins strapping in.
TRINITY
What do you think you're doing?
NEO
You need help. I'm coming with you.
TRINITY
No. No way. Morpheus sacrificed himself so you could escape.
There's no way you're going back in.
NEO
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something
that I'm not.
TRINITY
What?
NEO
I'm not the One, Trinity. The Oracle told me.
Trinity is stunned.
NEO
She said I had a gift but I still had a lot to learn. She told me
maybe next life.
TRINITY
Did you tell Morpheus?
NEO
Why? It wouldn't mean anything. He'd still believe what he wanted
to believe. But Morpheus is the one that matters. He's more
important than me and we both know it.
He straps in.
NEO
I may not be what Morpheus thinks I am, but if I don't try to help
him, then I'm not even what I think I am.
TRINITY
What are you?
NEO
His friend.
INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY
Agent Smith sits casually across from Morpheus who is hunched over, his body leaking and twitching.
AGENT SMITH
I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here.
It came to me when I tried to classify your species. I've
realized that you are not actually mammals.
The life signs continue their chaotic patterns.
AGENT SMITH
Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural
equilibrium with the surrounding environment. But you humans do
not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to
spread to another area.
He leans forward.
AGENT SMITH
There is another organism on this planet that follows the same
pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus.
He smiles.
AGENT SMITH
Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You are a
plague. And we are... the cure.

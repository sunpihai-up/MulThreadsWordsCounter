EXT. EL TRAIN
An EL TRAIN RAGES against its metal rails.

INT. TRAIN
It is three a.m., and the train carries the usual urban
night crawlers. Neo sits alone, eyes shifting, watching
everything nervously.
There is a METAL BANG and TRAIN CLATTER fills the car as
the door is opened.
Neo turns and sees a large man enter. He is wearing
sunglasses and a black leather jacket. His name is APOC
and he walks straight at Neo.
APOC
Come with me.
Neo stands just as the door at the opposite end opens and
two police officers rush in, drawing their guns.
Apoc grabs Neo, muscling him to the nearest exit. There
is no upcoming station.
Apoc yanks the emergency brake and the train buckles
against its own speed. The cops are thrown back. Neo
slams against the metal rail.
The doors open onto nothing and just when Neo regains his
balance, Apoc shoves him backwards --
He flies out from the train, arms windrilling as he falls
from, the raised tracks --
Hurtling towards a busy city street when, out of nowhere,
a truck races under him and --
He crashes into a large dumpster-bed filled with empty
boxes.

INT. TRUCK BED
Still shaking his head, Neo realizes he is not alone. A
man named Cabie is aiming a big gun at him. Trinity is
next to him, talking into a cellular phone.
TRINITY
We got him. Call the chop-shop.
She hangs up.
TRINITY
Listen to me, Neo. You have to,
trust us.
She tears off a long strip of black duct-tape and reaches
for his face.
NEO
What are you doing?
TRINITY
This has to be done for your protection and ours.
She seals his eyes shut with the tape.
TRINITY
You can't understand right now, but if you're not one of us,
you're one of them.

EXT. LOWER WACKER
A featureless black van glides up to a staircase that
curls down from the city's surface.
trinity guides the blind Neo down the steps. The back of
the van slaps open, revealing a young, skinny man who
looks to be still in his teens, wearing an outfit that is
a cross between a surgeon and a telephone repair man.
His name is GIZMO and he smiles lewdly at Trinity,
exposing his teeth that are wired with weird-looking
braces.
GIZMO
Va va va voom. Still the hottest software around.
TRINITY
Hello, Gizmo.
Neo hears the voices around him.
GIZMO
This is really the guy? The guy that Morpheus thinks --
TRINITY
Yeah.
GIZMO
But he's so old.
TRINITY
Are you going to help us or aren't you?
GIZMO
Hacksaw. Load up the copper-top and let's get the hell outta here.
Hacksaw is a huge man in a leather welder's apron. He
shoulders Neo and hauls him into the van.
A moment later the green lights of Lower Wacker curve
over the tinted windshield as the van rushes through the
underworld.

INT. VAN
The chop-shop is filled with electronic gadgets, wired to
meters and monitors. There are shelves lined with
medical supplies and rows of hanging tools, knives,
cleavers, and stainless steel clamps.
Neo is strapped down to an ambulance cart, listening
nervously as Gizmo gets to work.
GIZMO
Okay, first we take a little look under the hood.
He pulls up the goggles hanging at his neck and they
blink to life with tiny halogen lights and lenses irising
to varying levels of magnification.
GIZMO
You're going to feel a little prick.
He inserts acupuncture-like needles into Neo's lower
abdomen. The needles are wired to video monitors.
Hacksaw pilots the fiber-optic lens.
NEO
What are you doing?
TRINITY
We think you're bugged. We can't take you to Morpheus
until you're clean.
GIZMO
There it is.
On a monitor, we see the bug nestled in among Neols large
intestines.
GIZMO
Hit him with 10 ccs of local.
Hacksaw loads a hypodermic needle and pumps an anesthetic
around Neols navel.
Using a device that looks like a miniature speculum,
Gizmo inserts a knuckled dental pick. Typing into a
calculator keypad wired to the pick, he automates the
tip.
On the monitor, we watch it telescope out and the end
separate into a tiny hooked, metal claw.
GIZMO
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
The claw snags hold of the bug.
GIZMO
Gotcha!
But the bug reacts violently. Neo screams as it wraps
itself around the soft tissue web of intestine.
GIZMO
Shit.
TRINITY
What's happening?
GIZMO
I don't know. They've never done that before.
Neo writhes in pain.
GIZMO
Hold him down.
NEO
Jesus! God!
TRINITY
Do something!
GIZMO
I got it! Maybe we can stun it.
TRINITY
Are you crazy? That will kill him.
We watch Neo, who can't see what they are talking about.
GIZMO
It'll work. Come on, do it or Hacksaw will.
NEO
Do what?
The instant he hears the word, he knows.
TRINITY
Clear.
NEO
Oh, shit --
The cry is frozen in his mouth as the paddles hit his
chest. Gizmo wrestles with the bug.
GIZMO
Hit him again!
Again, the electricity convulses through him as Gizmo
yanks the speculum out.
GIZMO
Got it!
Trinity touches Neo, who is just beginning to breathe.
She eases the tape off his eyes.
TRINITY
Neo, are you okay?
He nods.
TRINITY
It's over. We got it.
Hanging from the claw pick is the inanimate metal wire-
tap.
GIZMO
Nasty little bugger, ain't it?

INT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE
The van stops in a deserted alley behind a forgotten
hotel. The doors open and Trinity helps Neo get out.
TRINITY
Thanks for your help, Gizmo.
GIZMO
I just hope the man knows what
he's doing.
She nods then climbs out of the van. Gizmo ogles the
tight leather pants.
GIZMO
Goddamn, what I wouldn't give for
a copy of that software.
Trinity turns around.
TRINITY
Gizmo, you don't have the hardware
to handle this software.
He howls with adolescent laughter as the van pulls away.
Trinity turns to Neo.
TRINITY
Let's go. He's waiting.

INT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE
It is a place of putrefying elegance, a rotting host of
urban maggotry.
Trinity leads Neo from the stairwell down the hall of the
thirteenth floor. They stop outside room 1313.
TRINITY
This is it.
Neo can hear his own heart pounding.
TRINITY
Let me give one piece of advice. Be honest. He knows more than you can possibly imagine.

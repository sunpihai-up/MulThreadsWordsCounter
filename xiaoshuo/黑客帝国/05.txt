EXT. SKYSCRAPER
The downtown office of CorTechs, a software development
company.

INT. CORTECHS OFFICE
The main offices are along each wall, the windows
overlooking downtown Chicago.
RHINEHEART, the ultimate company man, lectures Neo
without looking at him, typing at his computer
continuously.
Neo stares at two window cleaners on a scaffolding
outside, dragging their rubber squeegees down across the
surface of the glass.
RHINEHEART
You have a problem, Mr. Anderson.
You think that you're special.
You believe that somehow the rules do not apply to you.
He stops, glancing over his glasses at Neo, who turns in
time.
RHINEHEART
Obviously, you are mistaken.
His long, bony fingers resume clicking the keyboard.
RHINEHEART
This company is one of the top software companies in the world
because every single employee understands that they are a part
of a whole. Thus, if an employee has a problem, the company has a
problem.
He turns again.
RHINEHEART
The time has come to make a choice, Mr. Anderson. Either you
choose to be at your desk on time from this day forth, or you choose to find yourself another job. Do I make myself clear?
NEO
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart. Perfectly
clear.
INT. NEO'S CUBICLE
The entire floor looks like a human honeycomb, with a
labyrinth of cubicles structured around a core of
elevators.
Neo slumps down into his chair. A TALL EMPLOYEE stands
up in the adjacent cubicle, leaning over the partition.
TALL EMPLOYEE
What did he say?
NEO
If I was late again, I'm going to be fired.
He smirks.
TALL EMPLOYEE
Well, it was nice working with you.
Neo glares at him, as he sinks down.
VOICE (O.S.)
Thomas Anderson?
Neo turns and finds a FEDERAL EXPRESS MAN at his cubicle
door.
NEO
Yeah. That's me.
Neo signs the electronic pad and the Fedex guy hands him
the softpak.
FEDEX
Have a nice day.
He opens the bag. Inside is a CELLULAR PHONE. It seems
the instant it is in his hand, it RINGS. Unnerved, he
flips it open.
NEO
Hello?
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Hello, Neo. This is Morpheus.
Neo's knees give and he falls into his chair.
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
I had hoped for this conversation to take place under less adverse
conditions, but you can never count on hope, can you, Neo?
NEO
... no.
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
I've been watching you, Neo, and I want to meet you. I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time. They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not
sure what they're going to do.
NEO
Who's coming for me?
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Stand up and see for yourself.
NEO
Right now?
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Yes. Now.
Neo starts to stand.
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Do it slowly. Slowly. The elevator.
His head slowly peeks up over the partition.
At the elevator, he sees Agent Brown and Agent Jones
leading a group of cops. A female employee turns and
points out Neo's cubicle.
Neo ducks.
NEO
Holy fuckin' shit!
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Yes.
One cop stays at the elevator, the others follow the agents.
NEO
What the fuck do they want with me?!
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
I'm not sure. But, if you don't want to find out, you better get
out of there.
NEO
How?!
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.
The agents are moving quickly towards the cubicle.
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
The cubicle across from you is empty.
NEO
But what if...?
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Go! Now!
Neo lunges across the hall, diving into the other cubicle
just as the agents turn into his row.
Neo crams himself into a dark corner, clutching the phone
tightly to him.
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Stay here for a moment.
The agents enter Neo's empty cubicle. A cop is sent to
search the bathroom.
Morpheus' voice is a whisper in Neo's ear.
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
A little longer...
Brown is talking to the tall employee.
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
When I tell you, go to the end of the row to the first office on the
left, stay.as low as you can.
Sweat trickles down his forehead.
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Now.
Neo rolls out of the cubicle, his eyes popping as he
freezes right behind a cop who has just turned around.
Staying crouched, he sneaks away, down the row, SHOOTING
across the opening to the first office on the left.
The room is empty.
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Good. Now there is a window. Open it.
NEO
How do you know all this?
Morpheus laughs quietly.
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
The answer is coming, Neo.
He opens the window. The window howls into the room.
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Outside, there's a scaffold. You can use it to get to the roof.
Leaning out the window, he sees that the scaffold is
several offices away.
NEO
No! It's too far away.
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
There's a small ledge. It's a
short climb. You can make it.
Neo looks down; the building's glass wall vertigos into a
concrete chasm.
NEO
No way, no way, this is crazy.
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Don't be controlled by your fear, Neo. There are only two ways out
of this building. One is that scaffold. The other is in their
custody. You take a chance either way. I leave it to you.
CLICK. He hangs up. Neo looks at the door, then back at
the scaffold.
NEO
This is insane! Why is this happening to me? What did I do?
I'm nobody. I didn't do anything. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
He climbs up onto the window ledge. Hanging onto the
frame, he steps onto the small ledge.
The scaffold seems even farther away.
NEO
I'm going to die.
The WIND suddenly BLASTS up the face of the building,
knocking Neo off balance. Recoiling, he clings harder to
the frame, and the phone falls out of his hand.
He watches as it is swallowed by the distance beneath him.
NEO
This is insane. I can't do this!
Forget it!
He climbs back into the office just as a cop opens the
door.
NEO
I didn't do anything!

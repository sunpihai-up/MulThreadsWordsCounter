of Buckingham his Grace, Lord High Admiral of England 
EXCELLENT LORD - Solomon says; a good name is as a precious ointment; and I assure my self, such will your Grace\'s name be, with posterity. For your fortune, and merit both, have been eminent And you have planted things, that are like to last I do now publish my essays; which, of all my other works, have been most current: for that, as it seems, they come home, to men\'s business, and bosoms. I have enlarged them, both in number, and weight; so that they are indeed a new work. I thought it therefore agreeable, to my affection, and obligation to your Grace, to prefix your name before them, both in English, and in Latin. For I do conceive, (hat the Latin volume of them (being in the universal language) may last, as long as books last My Instauation, I dedicated to the King: my History of Henry the Seventh (which I have now also translated into Latin) and my portions of Natural History, to the Prince: and these I dedicate to your Grace;being of the best fruits, that by the good increase, which God gives to my pen and labours, I could yield. God lead your Grace by the hand. Your 
Grace\'s most obliged and faithful servant¡£

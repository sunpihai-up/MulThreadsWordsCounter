Deformed persons are commonly even with nature: for as nature hath done ill by them, so do they by nature: being for the most part, (as die scripture saith) void of natural affection; and so they have their revenge of nature. Certainly there is a consent between the body and the mind; and where nature erreth in the one, she ventureth in the other. Ubipecattmiw.periditaturinaltem. But because there is in man an election touching the frame of his mind, and a necessity in the frame of his body, the stars of natural inclination are sometimes obscured by the sun of discipline, and virtue. 

Therefore, it is good to consider of deformity, not as a sign, which is more deceivable; but as a cause, which seldom failed of the effect Whosoever hath anything fixed in his person, thafdoth induce contempt, hath also a perpetual spur in himself, to rescue and deliver himself from scorn: therefore all deformed persons are extreme bold. 
First, as in their own defence, as being exposed to scorn; but in process of time, by a general habit Also it stirreth in (hem industry, and especially of this kind, to watch and observe the weakness of others, that they may have somewhat to repay. 
Again, in their superiors, it quencheth jealousy towards them, as persons that they mink they may at pleasure despise: and it layeth their competitors and emulators asleep; as never believing, they should be in possibility of advancement till they see them in possession. So that, upon the matter, in a great wit, deformity is an advantage to rising. Kings in ancient times (and at this present in some countries) were wont to put great trust in eunuchs; because they that are envious towards all, are more obnoxious and officious towards one. But yet their trust towards them hath rather been as to good spials, and good whisperers; man good magistrates, and officers. 
And much like is the reason of deformed persons. Still the ground is, they will, if they be of spirit, seek to free themselves from scorn; which must be, either by virtue, or malice: and therefore, let it not be marvelled, if sometimes they prove excellent persons; as was Agesilaus, Zanger the son of Solyman, Aesop, Gasca President of Peru; and Socrates may go likewise amongst them; with others.

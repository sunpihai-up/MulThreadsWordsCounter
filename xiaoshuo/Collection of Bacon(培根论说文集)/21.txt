Fortune is like the market; where many times, if you can stay a little, the price 
will fall. And again, it is sometimes like Sybilla\'s offer, which at first offereth 
the commodity at full, then consumeth part and part, and still holdeth up the price. 

For occasion (as it is in the common verse) tumefh a bald noddle, after he hath 
presented her locks in front, and no hold taken: or at least tumeth the handle of 
the bottle, first to be received, and after the belly, which is hard to clasp. There 
is surely no greater wisdom, then well to time the beginnings and onsets of things. 

Dangers are no more light, if they once seem light:
and more dangers have deceived men, than forced them. Nay, it were better, to meet some dangers half way, though they come nothing near, than to keep too long a watch upon their approaches; for if a man watch too long, it is odds he will fall asleep. 
On the other side, to be deceived, with too long shadows (as some have been, when the moon was low, and shone on their enemies back), and so to shoot off before the time; or to teach dangers to come on, by over early buckling towards them, is another extreme. The ripeness, or unripeness of the occasion (as we said) must ever be well weighed; and generally, it is good, to commit the beginnings of all great actions to Argos with his hundred eyes; and the ends to Briareus with his hundred hands: first to watch, and then to speed. For the helmet of Pluto, which maketh the politic man go invisible, is secrecy in the counsel, and celerity in the execution. 
For when things are once come to the execution, there is no secrecy comparable to celerity; like the motion of a bullet in the air, which flieth so swift, as it outruns the eye.

INT. JAIL CELL - DAY
EXTREME CLOSE-UP on a DROP OF WATER, gathering at the tip OFa faucet, a FLASH OF LIGHT refracting through it just before it FALLS.......
PULLING BACK slowly, we see ANOTHER DROP OF WATER gather andFALL... and then ANOTHER... into a METAL SINK BASIN filled with water, rippling in concentric circles with each DROP, which we HEAR in a steady rhythm: DRIP... DRIP... DRIP...
RICKY (O.C.)(singing in time to the water dripping)I'M FIXING A HOLE... WHERE THE RAIN GETS IN....
REVERSE ANGLE on the face OF a YOUNG MAN with his hair cutshort, military-style, watching the dripping water as if hypnotized. We ZOOM slowly toward him...
This is RICKY FITTS. He's twenty, but his eyes are much older. Underneath his Zen-like tranquility lurks something wounded... and dangerous. He SINGS softly to himself:
RICKY (cont'd)AND STOPS MY MIND FROM WANDERING...
Through the bars OF his CELL we see RICKY is seated on theedge of a solitary cot in a JAIL CELL, staring intently at the metal sink on the wall across from him..
RICKY (cont'd)WHERE IT WILL GO...
ON TELEVISION: INT. COURTROOM - DAY
A sullen TEENAGE GIRL sits at a table in a COURTROOM, surrounded by lawyers. SUPERIMPOSED across the bottom of screen: TEENAGE GIRL ACCUSED OF HIRING FATHER'S KILLER. At the lower right corner is the JUSTICE TV logo. In the upper right corner: LIVE.
This girl is JANE BURNHAM. Seventeen-years-old, with dark, intense eyes. She stares blankly at the table in front of her.
D.A. (O.C.)Would you please tell the court how long you and the defendant have been friends?
ANGELA (O.C.)Uh, we've known each other since like, fifth grade? But we didn't really become friends until this past year?
Jane looks up, her eyes hostile, at:
Seated on the witness stand is seventeen-year-old ANGELAHAYES. Strikingly beautiful, with perfect, even features, blonde hair, and a nubile young body, she's the archetypal American dream girl. She is being questioned by a DISTRICT ATTORNEY.
D.A.During that time, did Jane ever say she disliked her father?
INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS
We're now in the courtroom, where the JUSTICE TV CAMERAS focus on Angela as the D.A. questions her.
ANGELA Yes.
D.A.Exactly how did she say it?
ANGELA (cont'd)Uh, she said she hated his guts, and wished he was dead.
D.A.Did she tell you why?
Angela hesitates, hot eager to answer this. Finally:
ANGELA (cont'd)She said he was just too embarrassing to live, okay?
ANGELA looks at JANE, who stares at her with absolute hatred.
ANGELA (cont'd)She said both of her parents were totally embarrassing, but her dad was like, way beyond? And somebody had to take him out. But she said her mom was just pathetic and probably didn't deserve to like, die.
Elsewhere IN the COURTROOM, a very well-put-together WOMAN OFforty stifles a SOB. This is Jane's mother, CAROLYN BURNHAM.
BACK on the witness stand, ANGELA looks contrite.
ANGELA (cont'd)I'm sorry, Mrs. Burnham, but she did.
At her table, JANE buries her face IN her hands.
ANGELA (cont'd)You did. You said it.
INT. POLICE STATION - LOBBY - DAY
A suburban POLICE station. PHONES RINGING, officers withclipboards, lowlifes being booked. The usual.
The front door opens and COLONEL FRANK FITTS enters, carryinga MANILA ENVELOPE. He's fifty, quite handsome, his graying hair cut short, military-style. He still moves like the athlete he once was, but his eyes tell us he's not happy, and hasn't been for some time. As he approaches the front desk, the uniformed clerk behind it looks up at him impassively.
COLONELI need to speak to Detective Fleishman.
INT. POLICE STATION - DETECTIVE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
DETECTIVE FLEISHMAN, paunchy and constantly exhausted, opensthe door to his office and motions Colonel Fitts inside.
FLEISHMANColonel Pitts. How goes it?(off his look)Forgive me. That was a stupid question, after everything you've been through.
He shows the COLONEL to a chair, then sits behind his desk.
FLEISHMAN (cont'd)So what can I do for you?
The COLONEL sighs, looking at the MANILA ENVELOPE He holds.
COLONELI found something. I think you should take a look at it.
FLEISHMANOkay.
But the COLONEL just sits there, holding the envelope.
COLONELI don't want to do this.(fighting back tears)But I was taught a little thing called duty. Something I wasn't able to teach my own son...
He breaks down. FLEISHMAN crosses to him and places his handon his shoulder. The Colonel shrugs it off, violently.
COLONEL (cont'd)No.
Respectfully, FLEISHMAN steps back. the COLONEL pulls himselftogether and hands over the envelope, without looking up. Fleishman studies the envelope as he walks back to his desk, then opens it and takes out an unmarked HI-8 VIDEOCASSETTE. He looks at the Colonel quizzically.
INT. JAIL CELL - DAY
RICKY sits motionless, still focused on the DRIPPING water.
RICKY(singing softly)I'M FILLING THE CRACKS THAT RAN THROUGH THE DOOR...
ON TELEVISION:
A rapid-fire MONTAGE OF VIDEO IMAGERY taken from recent newsfootage, intercut with CELEBRITIES and scantily-clad MODELS of both sexes, accompanied by HEADBANGER MUSIC. THE REAL DIRT logo spins quickly into place, with exaggerated SOUND EFFECTS.
ON TELEVISION: INT. TABLOID news SHOW SET
A telegenic ANCHORPERSON addresses us. SUPERIMPOSED at lowerleft is THE REAL DIRT logo. Behind the Anchorperson is an INSET GRAPHIC of Jane and Ricky. 
ANCHORPERSON(Australian accent)Lester Burnham. Brutally murdered in cold blood, allegedly the victim of a teenage psychopath hired by his own daughter, Jane. The case that has outraged America, has now become even more shocking. Tonight on The Real Dirt, we'll show you - for the first time anywhere - an astonishing videotape in which Jane and alleged killer Richard Fitts actually make their unholy pact.
ON VIDEO: INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY
JANE is leaning BACK IN bed, naked, smoking a joint. stillSUPERIMPOSED at lower left is THE REAL DIRT logo, and Jane's breasts have been digitally BLURRED.
JANEI need a father who's a role model, not some horny geek-boy who's gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home from school.(snorts)Like he'd ever have a chance with her. What a lame-o. Somebody really should put him out of his misery.
A beat. JANE plays with her hair, lost IN thought.
RICKY (O.C.)Want me to kill him for you?
JANE stares at the camera incredulously, then LAUGHS.
JANEYeah, would you?
INT. COURT - DAY
We're TRACKING slowly across the mesmerized faces of the jury as they watch the videotape.
RICKY (O.C.)It'll cost you.
JANE (O.C.)I've been baby-sitting since I was ten, I've got almost three thousand dollars. 
We see the tape as it plays on the VIDEO MONITOR SET UP INthe front of the courtroom. This time there is no THE REAL DIRT logo nor any digital blurring of Jane's nudity. 
ON THE MONITOR: JANE sits UP IN bed, smiling.
JANE (cont'd)I was saving it for a boob job. 
ON THE MONITOR: JANE stands and shakes her breasts.
In the courtroom, Jane's mother Carolyn watches, stunned, gripping the arm of a well-dressed, silver-haired MAN at her side.
JANE (O.C.) (cont'd)But my tits can wait.
Jane watches from her seat, her face a mixture of anger, disbelief and helplessness. We ZOOM toward her slowly.
RICKY (O.C.)You know, that's not a very nice thing to do, hiring somebody to kill your dad.
Tears spill from her blinking eyes, But she remains silent.ON THE MONITOR: Jane is back on the bed.
JANEWell, I guess I'm just not a very nice girl, then, am I?
ON THE MONITOR: she leans BACK and smiles dreamily at us.
INT. JAIL CELL - DAY
CLOSE on Ricky as he leans back on his cot, staring up at us, the same dreamy smile on his face.
RICKY(singing softly)I'M TAKING THE TIME FOR A NUMBER OFTHINGS... THAT WEREN'T IMPORTANT YESTERDAY...
FADE to BLACK.
In darkness, we HEAR Vic Damone singing "I'M NOBODY'S BABY," as the words "ONE YEAR EARLIER" FADE IN AND OUT.
FADE IN:
EXT. SUBURB - EARLY MORNING
We're FLYING high above an upper middle class SUBURB. The wide streets are lined with stately elms and sycamores; the homes are traditional and well-kept. Coming closer to the ground, we pick out a couple of male JOGGER.
A DIFFERENT ANGLE on the Joggers. We're at level now, MOVING alongside them. They're both in their thirties, athletic, blandly handsome. They pass a STREET SIGN that reads Robin Hood Trail.
Suddenly, a MAN comes into view, FLYING Superman-style aboutthree feet above their heads. He's wearing old-fashioned PAJAMAS, and a plaid flannel ROBE. As he passes overhead, the Joggers look up and wave excitedly, like children. He flashes them a grin and waves back, then he speeds up, leaving them behind.
As the MAN flies down the street, a BARKING DOG runs alongbeneath him, jumping into the air, trying to catch him. The Man swoops and dips effortlessly, teasing the dog, then spots, at the end of the street, a young boy on a bicycle tossing newspapers onto people's porches, or as close as he can get. Seeing the flying Man, the boy tosses a paper high into the air. The dog tears off to catch the paper. The flying Man LAUGHS and shoots upward like he's been blown out of a cannon, grabs the paper, and swoops down, dropping it lightly on the front porch of a well-appointed, two-story HOUSE with distinctive CEDAR SHINGLE SIDING and a RED FRONT DOOR.
The boy on the bike watches IN admiration. the MAN slowlyfloats by above him and tousles his hair. The dog BARKS. The boy throws another newspaper into the air, this time even higher than before, and the Man grins as he prepares to shoot up after it: this is going to be fun... and we SMASH CUT TO:
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
We HEAR the harsh BUZZ OF an ALARM CLOCK. Vic Damone stillsings "I'M NOBODY'S BABY" elsewhere in the house. Outside, a dog is still BARKING
The MAN we just saw FLYING Through the streets lies sleepingamidst expensive bed linens, wearing the same PAJAMAS. His hand reaches over and shuts the ALARM CLOCK OFF; his eyes remain clamped shut as he tries to hang onto his dream.... but it's gone. He sighs and opens his eyes. 
This man is LESTER BURNHAM, Carolyn's husband and Jane's father. He's forty-two, with a wide boyish face that's just beginning to droop around the edges. He sits up in bed and rubs his face.
We're in a large, comfortable bedroom that's tastefully decorated but not overdone - it could be a spread from Metropolitan Home. Lester gets out of the king-sized bed, crosses to a bay window covered with stylish wooden blinds, lifts one of the slats with his finger and peers through it. 
His POV: A DOG - the same dog from Lester's flying dream -BARKS excitedly at us from behind a white picket fence surrounding the front yard of the house across the street.
EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
The dog's POV: Lester looks down at us through the bay window of the HOUSE from his dream - we recognize the distinctive CEDAR SHINGLE SIDING. The dog continues to BARK.
LESTER (V.O.)My name is Lester Burnham. I'm forty two-years old. In less than a year, I'll be dead.INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BATH - MOMENTS LATER
We're in the shower with Lester. A waterproof RADIO plays COUNTRY MUSIC. He stands with his face directly in the hot spray1 eyes shut.
LESTER (V.O.)In a way, I'm dead already.
ANGLE from outside the shower: we see Lester's naked body silhouetted through the steamed-up glass door. It becomes apparent he is masturbating.
LESTER (V.O.) (cont'd)(amused)Look at me jerking off while I listen to country music. I hated this shit when I was growing up.(then)Funny thing is, this is the high point of my day. It's all downhill from here.
EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE front YARD - MOMENTS LATER
CLOSE on a single, dewy AMERICAN BEAUTY ROSE, perfect INshape and color. As we PULL BACK, a pair of gloved hands with CLIPPERS appear and SNIP the flower off.
We continue PULLING BACK to discover Carolyn BURNHAM IN herrose garden in front of the house, cutting flowers and placing them in a basket, a determined, humorless look on her face. Even now, she is perfectly put-together; she wears color-coordinated gardening togs and has lots of useful and expensive tools. 
LESTER (V.O.)That's my wife Carolyn. See the way the handle on those pruning shears matches her gardening clogs? That's not an accident
In the fenced front YARD OF the HOUSE across the street, thefamiliar dog is still BARKING. A well-groomed, athletic MAN in a conservative suit rolls a blue plastic city GARBAGE CONTAINER up the driveway to the curb.
JIM #1Bitsy. Hush.
LESTER (V.O.)That's our next-door neighbor Jim.
A second well-groomed, athletic MAN IN a conservative suitcomes out the front door.
JIM #2What in the world is wrong with her? She had a walk this morning.
JIM #1And a jerky treat.
JIM #2(frowns)You spoil her.
LESTER (V.O.)(re: the second man)And that's his lover Jim.
We recognize the two Jims as the joggers from Lester's dream.
JIM #2(sternly)Bitsy. No bark. Come inside. Now.
Bitsy, suddenly subdued, allows Jim #2 to usher her inside.
LESTER (V.O.)It's weird they have the same name, but that's really no fault of their own. 
As Jim #2 gets into a Ford Taurus, Jim #1 crosses the street to greet Carolyn.
JIM #1Morning, Carolyn.
CAROLYN(overly friendly)Good morning, Jim! I just love your tie! That color!
JIM #1 And I just love your roses. How do you get them to flourish like that?
CAROLYNWell, I'll tell you. Egg shells and Miracle Grow.
ANGLE on the second floor bay window of the Burnham's house, where Lester stands in a bathrobe, drying his hair as he looks down at them.
LESTER (V.O.)Man. I get exhausted just watching her.
His POV: We can't hear what they're saying, but Carolyn's facial expressions remain overly animated and cheerful, like those of a TV talk show host.
LESTER (V.O.) (cont'd)She wasn't always like this. She used to be happy. We used to be happy...
Jim #2 pulls the Ford Taurus into the street; Jim #1 waves to Carolyn, jumps inside and they drive off. Carolyn immediately reverts to her previous resolute expression as she continues cutting flowers.
LESTER (V.O.) (cont'd)But she doesn't have much use for me anymore. About the only thing that gets her excited now is money.
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
CLOSE on a young woman's hands counting DOLLAR BILLS. PULLING BACK, we see JANE BURNHAM, seated at a desk in her bedroom, wearing jeans and a tight cotton top with straps. As she counts, she has the same resolute expression as her mother. 
LESTER (V.O.)And this is my daughter Jane. Only child. She takes after her mother in a lot of ways, although she'd never admit it. 
Having finished counting, JANE paper-clips the money togetherthen types something into a computer.
CLOSE on the COMPUTER MONITOR: Personal banking software.We see the word DEPOSIT and the amount $38.00 as they're entered, then a new total in the balance column: $2,853.06.
JANE smiles, pleased. she stuffs the money into a KNAPSACKhanging on her closet door, then looks at herself in a full-length MIRROR. A beat, she turns sideways and arches her back so her breasts protrude as much as possible She frowns, then turns so she's facing the mirror, and hugs her herself tightly, to enhance the appearance of cleavage.
LESTER (V.O.) (cont'd)Janie is a pretty typical teenager. Angry, insecure, confused. I wish I could tell her all that's going to pass.(then)But I don't want to lie to her.
We HEAR a CAR HORN from outside. JANE grabs her KNAPSACK anda too-large flannel shirt from her closet and starts out.

We're FLYING high above the neighborhood, like in Lester's dream at the beginning. Below us we see the two Jims, jogging. We approach them steadily.
LESTER (V.O.)It's a great thing to realize you still have the ability to surprise yourself. Makes you wonder what else you can do that you've forgotten about...
EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - CONTINUOUS
We're now at street level, FOLLOWING the two Jims.
LESTER (O.C.)Hey! You guys!
Still running, the Jims turn back in perfect unison to see:
Their POV: LESTER, IN a baggy sweatshirt and a pair OF fadedold Ithaca College sweatpants, runs toward them.
They slow down until He catches UP, then the three men RUNtogether in the early morning light.
JIM #2Lester, I didn't know you ran.
LESTER(panting)Just started.
JIM #1Good for you.
LESTERI figured you guys might be able to give me some pointers. I need to shape up. Fast.
JIM #1Well, are you just looking to lose weight, or do you want increased strength and flexibility as well?
LESTERI want to look good naked.
EXT. FITTS HOUSE - LATER
The COLONEL is washing his Ford Explorer, squatting to scrubthe bumper, when something catches his eye:
His POV: LESTER and the Jims jog down the street.
The Colonel stands, scowling. Ricky comes out of the house, holding the URINE SPECIMEN CUP in front of him.
RICKYHere you go, Dad. Fresh-squeezed.
But the Colonel doesn't take it; he just keeps staring at the joggers, frowning.
COLONELWhat is this, the fucking gay pride parade?
Just then, LESTER sees RICKY and waves.
LESTERYo! Ricky!
He breaks off from the two Jims, slapping one OF them on theback as he does, then heads down the Fitts' driveway. The Colonel turns and looks at Ricky, uneasy.
RICKYThat's Mr. Burnham. He lives next door.
LESTER jogs UP to them, out OF breath. He grabs hold OF hisknees and bends over, panting.
LESTERMy entire e life is flashing in front of my eyes, and those two barely broke a sweat. 
He LAUGHS, and extends his hand to the Colonel.
LESTER (cont'd)Hi, I'm Lester Burnham.
COLONEL(shakes)Colonel Frank Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps.
LESTERWhoa. Welcome to the neighborhood, sir.
He salutes the COLONEL good-naturedly, grinning. the COLONELdoesn't think it's funny. An awkward beat.
LESTER (cont'd)So, Ricky, uh, when you get a chance, I just...(stalls, then, pointed)I just was thinking about that movie you told me about...
RICKY(quickly)RE-ANIMATOR. Yeah. I've got it on tape. Want to borrow it?(before Lester can answer)It's up in my room. Come on.
He heads into the house. LESTER smiles at the COLONEL, thenfollows him. The Colonel watches them go, his eyes dark.
INT. FITTS HOUSE - living ROOM MOMENTS LATER
CLOSE on a TV: We're watching a NATURE DOCUMENTARY. Pale, swollen ocean-bottom creatures lunge toward their unsuspecting prey in SLOW MOTION.
BARBARA FITTS sits across from the TV, looking somewhere INits general direction. Ricky and Lester enter.
RICKYMom. This is Lester. He lives next door.
BARBARA(distant)All right, be careful.
RICKY and LESTER head UP the stairs.
INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
RICKY enters, followed By Lester.
RICKYCan you hold his for a sec?
He gives the URINE SPECIMEN to LESTER, then locks the door.
RICKY (cont'd)I don't think my dad would try to come in when somebody else is here, but you never know.
RICKY crosses to a bureau and opens a DRAWER. He takesclothing out and piles it on his bed.
LESTER(re: urine cup)What is this?
RICKYUrine. I have to take a drug test every six months to make sure I'm clean. 
LESTERAre you kidding? You just smoked with me last night.
RICKYIt's not mine. One of my clients is a nurse in a pediatrician's office. I cut her a deal, she keeps me in clean piss.
LESTERSweet.
Lester picks up a CD case from a shelf and examines it: it's The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
LESTER (cont'd)You a Beatles fan?
RICKYI like a lot of music.
LESTER(mockingly)When everybody else in junior high was listening to the Beatles, I was into Three Dog Night.
He shakes his head, then puts the CD Case down. RICKY, Havingemptied the drawer, now removes a FALSE BOTTOM, revealing rows of MARIJUANA tightly packed in ZIP-LOC BAGS.
RICKYHow much do you want?
LESTER
Uh, I'm not sure. It's been a while. How much is an ounce?
RICKY(indicates bag)Well, this is totally decent, and it's three hundred.
LESTERWow.
RICKY(indicates another bag)But this shit is top of the line, It's called G-143. Genetically engineered by the U.S. Government. Extremely potent. But a completely mellow high, no paranoia.
LESTERIs that what we smoked last night?
RICKYThis is all I ever smoke.
LESTERHow much?
RICKYTwo grand.
LESTERJesus. Things have certainly changed since 1973.
RICKYYou don't have to pay now. I know you're good for it.
A beat.
LESTERThanks.
RICKY hands him a bag OF the Top-OF-the-line dope.
RICKYThere's a card in there with my beeper number, feel free to call me anytime day a or night. Oh, and I only accept
LESTER(looks around room)Well, now I know how you can afford all this equipment. When I was your age, I worked at McDonald's all summer just to buy an eight track.
RICKYThat sucks.
LESTERActually, it was probably the best time of my life. All I did was party and get laid.
RICKY starts putting the DRAWER BACK together.
RICKYMy dad thinks I paid for all this with catering jobs.(laughs)Never underestimate the power of denial.
ANGLE ON Lester, smiling. This kid's cool.
EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY
Carolyn, carrying a basket OF fresh cut ROSES, passes By theGARAGE DOOR WINDOW. From inside the garage, we HEAR The Beatles' "COME TOGETHER." Carolyn stops and SNIFFS the air, frowning. She peers through the window.
Her POV: LESTER, IN a T- shirt and gym short.9, lies on a newWEIGHT BENCH, doing bench presses with shiny new BARBELLS.
INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
Come together blasts from a new BOOMBOX on the floor. LESTERfinishes his last rep, straining, then puts the weights in their rack on the bench and sits up, sweaty and out of breath. He takes a drag off a joint, then picks up a BOOK off the floor, a bodybuilding manual titled THE COMPLETE BOOK OF CHEST AND ARMS. Suddenly, the GARAGE DOOR starts to open. Lester looks up, squinting at:
His POV: the door raises to reveal Carolyn, silhouettedagainst the bright sunlight outside, standing in front of the Mercedes-Benz ML320, pointing a REMOTE at us.
LESTER just LAUGHS. Carolyn strides IN, still holding herbasket of roses, angry. She tries to turn off the BOOMBOX, but every time she pushes a button, it skips to the next song, or he FM tuner, she yanks the power cord out of the wall.
LESTEROoh. Mom's mad.
CAROLYNWhat the hell do you think you're doing?
LESTERBench presses. I'm going to wail on my pecs, and then I'm going to do my back.
CAROLYNYou're smoking pot now? That's a fine example to set for our daughter.
LESTERYou're one to talk, you bloodless, money-grubbing freak.
Carolyn is furious, But unable to think OF a response, Havingaccepted that reason is no longer an option with him.
CAROLYN(finally, re: equipment)You took the Mercedes to get all this stuff?
LESTEROf course I did. The Camry's too small.
CAROLYNWere you stoned then?
LESTERWhat are you going to do, ground me?
CAROLYNLester, that is a forty-thousand dollar car. I don't want you driving it when -
LESTERFine. I'll never drive your precious Mercedes again. Big whoop. It's just a glorified station wagon that you paid way too much for because you want to impress people.
A beat. Carolyn stands there, powerless and hating it.
LESTER (cont'd)Do you mind? I'm trying to work out here.(then, suggestively)Unless you want to spot me.
Struggling FOR dignity, Carolyn turns and walks out, thenstops at the garage door and turns back to him.
CAROLYNYou will not get away with this, mister! I promise you!
And she's gone. Lester smiles, then leans back on the bench and grabs the weights.
LESTER(as he lifts)That's. What. You. Think.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
CLOSE on a COMPUTER MONITOR: We're in some sort of virtual-reality post-apocalyptic environment. Hideous armed MUTANTS approach from all angles, shooting at us. One by one, they're blown away, their heads EXPLODING in geysers of BLOOD.
LESTER (O.C.)Take that, alien bitches!
Lester sits in his cubicle at work, glued to his monitor, feverishly handling a JOYSTICK.
LESTER (cont'd)Woo-hoo!
From the surrounding cubicles, his co-workers watch blankly.
INT. BRAD'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
BRAD is seated behind his desk, reading a document. LESTERsits across from him, smiling.
BRAD(reads)...my job consists of basically masking my contempt for the assholes in charge, and, at least once a day, retiring to the men's room so I can jerk off while I fantasize about a life that doesn't so closely resemble hell.(looks up at Lester)Well, you obviously have no interest in saving yourself.
LESTER(laughs)I've spent fourteen years being a whore for the advertising industry. The only way I could save myself now is to start firebombing.
BRADWhatever. Management wants you gone by the end of the day.
LESTERWhoa. What kind of severance package is "management" prepared to give me? Considering the information I have about our editorial director buying pussy with company money.
A beat.
LESTER (cont'd)Which I'm sure would interest the I.R.S., since, technically, it does constitute fraud. And some of our advertisers and rival publications might like to know about it as well. Not to mention Craig's wife.
A beat. BRAD sighs.
BRADWhat do you want?
LESTEROne year's salary, with continued benefits.
BRADThat's not going to happen.
LESTERWhat if I throw in a little sexual harassment charge?
BRAD LAUGHS.
BRADAgainst who? 
LESTERAgainst you.
BRAD stops LAUGHING.
LESTER (cont'd)Can you prove you didn't offer to save my job if I'd let you blow me?
BRAD leans BACK IN his chair, studying Lester.
BRADMan. You are one twisted fuck.
LESTER(standing)Nope. Just an ordinary guy with nothing to lose.
LESTER starts toward the door, then:
LESTER (cont'd)I hope you and I can still be friends, Brad. And even though you didn't save my job...(smiling)You can still blow me, asshole.
And He exits.

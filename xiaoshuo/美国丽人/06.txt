ON VIDEO: We're across from Jane's window, peering in. Jane tries to shut the drapes, but Angela won't let her. Irritated, Jane retreats into the room. We ZOOM toward her, even as Angela poses in the window, waving, but we're clearly not interested in Angela. The ZOOM continues, searching for Jane, who has disappeared. Finally, we settle on the full-length MIRROR on the open closet door, where we see a REFLECTION of Jane, back at her computer. She's smiling.
INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
RICKY sits IN darkness with his VIDEO camera, videotapingthrough the open window. He lowers his camera and smiles... then something below catches his attention. He leans out the window to get better look at:
EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE -GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
Ricky's POV: Through a WINDOW on the front of the Burnham's GARAGE DOOR, we see Lester, still in his suit, digging through shelves against the back wall. 
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
LESTER pulls aside old board games, badminton racquets, andstrings of Christmas lights, searching for something as if his very life depended on it. 
LESTERShit. Shit!
Then He yanks aside a box OF wallpaper scrap, and his facelights up at what he finds:
A pair OF DUMBBELLS, obviously unused FOR many years.
LESTER rips off his jacket and tie and unbuttons his shirt.He glances around, finding his REFLECTION in the WINDOW as he pulls off his shirt, then the T-shirt underneath.
He eyes himself critically: Angela was right, he's not in bad shape. Naturally broad-shouldered, with just a few extra pounds around his middle that wouldn't be hard to shed. He kicks off his shoes and begins to step out of his pants.
INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
RICKY holds his camera UP and starts to videotape.
EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
Ricky's POV, on VIDEO: Through the GARAGE DOOR WINDOW, we see Lester stepping out of his pants. He then pulls off his briefs, and stands there naked, except for black socks. He grabs the dumbbells and starts lifting them over his head; although he's watching his reflection in the window, it looks like he's watching us as we're watching him...
INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
RICKY stands at the open window, videotaping.
RICKYWelcome to America's Weirdest Home Videos.
Suddenly we HEAR someone trying to open the door from theother side - it's locked.
COLONEL (O.C.)Ricky!
MOVING swiftly, RICKY pulls the drapes shut and switches on alight. His room is a haven of high-tech. A state-of-the-art multimedia COMPUTER crowds his desk, and high-end STEREO and VIDEO EQUIPMENT line the shelves, as well as HUNDREDS OF CDs. There is easily twenty thousand dollars worth of equipment in this room.
RICKYComing, Dad.
COLONEL (O.C.)You know I don't like locked doors in my house, boy.
RICKY grabs a REMOTE and switches on his wide-screen TV justbefore he opens the door.
RICKYI must have locked it by accident, sorry. So what's up?
The COLONEL holds out a small PLASTIC CUP with a CAP.
COLONELI need a urine sample.
RICKYWow. Is it six months already? Can I give it to you in the morning? I just took a whiz.
The Colonel doesn't respond. His eyes are focused on:
On the TV: the shower scene from Top Gun plays. Seminudeyoung MALE BODIES, artfully lit.
COLONELWhat the hell is that?
RICKY turns to the TV.
RICKYTop Gun. It's about pilot training in the Air Force. You never saw it?
The COLONEL shakes his head, eyes glued to the screen.
RICKY (cont'd)Oh, you would love this movie, Dad. Want to watch it with me?
The COLONEL looks at him sharply, then:
COLONELNo.
He quickly walks down the hall. RICKY smiles, shuts andlocks his door. He puts the plastic cup on the shelf, then crosses to a MINI REFRIGERATOR in the corner of his room and opens it. He takes out a cup-sized TUPPERWARE CONTAINER from the freezer, already filled with urine, albeit frozen, and places it on a saucer to thaw overnight. 
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
Carolyn lies sleeping; Lester is awake, staring at the ceiling. After a moment, he gets up taking care not to disturb Carolyn, and walks toward the bathroom.
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BATH - CONTINUOUS
LESTER enters and switches on the LIGHT. the ROOM is filledwith STEAM. Lester looks around, confused, then focuses on:
His POV: across from us, IN a PEDESTAL BATHTUB, is Angela.She smiles and beckons us, and we MOVE CLOSER. ROSE PETALS float on the surface of the water, obscuring her naked body.
ANGELAI've been waiting for you.
LESTER kneels By the BATHTUB like a MAN IN church. ANGELAreaches out and feels his biceps.
ANGELA (cont'd)Oh! You've been working out, haven't you? I can tell.
She arches her BACK, and her breasts protrude Through thesurface of the water. She looks up at Lester.
ANGELA (cont'd)I was hoping you'd give me a bath... I'm very, very dirty.
LESTER gives her a hard look, then slowly slips his hand intothe water between her legs. Her eyes widen and she throws her head back... and we SMASH CUT TO:
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE 0- MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
CLOSE on Carolyn, her eyes wide, listening to the rhythmicBRUSH of Lester's hand as he masturbates under the covers.
She flips over and faces him.
CAROLYNWhat are you doing?
A beat.
LESTERWhat does it look like I'm doing? I'm whacking off.
CAROLYNWhat?!
She switches on the bedside light and gets out OF bed.Lester LAUGHS.
LESTERSpanking the monkey. Flogging the bishop. Choking the chicken. Jerking the gherkin.
CAROLYNHow disgusting.
LESTEROh. Well, forgive me, but I still have blood pumping through my veins!
A beat. Carolyn sits IN a chair across the ROOM from him.
CAROLYNLester. I refuse to live like this. This is not a marriage.
LESTERThis hasn't been a marriage for years. But you were perfectly happy as long as I kept my mouth shut. Well, guess what? I've changed. And the new me whacks off when he feels horny, because you're obviously not going to help me out in that department.
CAROLYN(furious)Don't mess with me, mister, or I will divorce you so fast it'll make your head spin!LESTEROn what grounds? I'm not a drunk, I don't fuck other women, I've never hit you, or mistreated you, or even tried to touch you since you made it clear just how unnecessary you consider me to be. But. I did support you while you got your license. And some people might think that entitles me to half of what's yours.
She's stunned - it's clear he knows where she's most vulnerable. He sees this, and likes it; it feels good to win for a change. He curls up under the covers contentedly.
LESTER (cont'd)Turn the light off when you come to bed, okay?
Carolyn just sits there, staring at him with absolute hatred.
FADE to BLACK.

CLOSE on the front door, as it opens to reveal Carolyn, greeting us with her most winning smile - the smile she thinks could sell ice to an Eskimo.
CAROLYNWelcome. I'm Carolyn Burnham!
MUSIC ENDS.
INT. SALE HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS
Smiling, Carolyn leads a MAN and WOMAN into the living room.They're thirtyish, and they've seen a lot of houses today.
MAN(looking up) How high is that ceiling?
CAROLYNOver twenty feet.
WOMANThat color is hideous.
CAROLYNa simple cream would really lighten things up. You couldeven put in a skylight.
The WOMAN wrinkles her face, skeptical.
CAROLYN (cont'd)Wait 'til you see the kitchen.
INT. SALE HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER
Carolyn enters, still Smiling, followed By a DIFFERENT COUPLEin their fifties.
CAROLYNAs you can see, it's been completely remodeled.
MAN(opening cabinet)These have just been refaced. no new construction.
WOMAN(re: faucet)What is this, gold?
CAROLYNNo, it's solid brass.
WOMANKinda gaudy, isn't it?
INT. SALE HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER
Carolyn stands with a different COUPLE: African American, late twenties. The woman is pregnant.
CAROLYN...and you'll be surprised how much a ceiling fan can cut down on your energy costs.
MANI got a cousin, he was a ballplayer. Ceiling fan fell on him in a bar and severed a tendon in his shoulder. Never fully regained use of that arm. Ruined his career.
Carolyn just stares at him, still smiling.
EXT. SALE HOUSE - BACK YARD - LATER
Carolyn stands By the pool next to two thirtyish WOMEN withidentical haircuts.
WOMANThe ad said this pool was "lagoon-like." But there's nothing "lagoon-like" about it. Except for maybe the bugs.(slaps her arm)There's not even any plants out here.
CAROLYNI have an excellent landscape architect -
WOMANI mean, I think "lagoon," and I think waterfall, I think tropical. This is just a cement hole.
A beat.
CAROLYNThere are some tiki torches in the garage.
The Women stare at her; she just keeps smiling.
INT. SALE HOUSE - SUN ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Carolyn enters, alone. She's furious, much more furious than she should be. She locks the sliding glass door and starts to pull the vertical blinds shut, then stops. Standing very still, with the blinds casting shadows across her face, she starts to cry: brief, staccato SOBS that seemingly escape against her will. Suddenly she SLAPS herself, hard.
CAROLYNStop it.
But the Tears continue. she SLAPS herself again.
CAROLYN (cont'd)Weak. Baby. Shut up. Shut up!
She SLAPS herself repeatedly until she stops crying. shestands. there, taking deep, even breaths until she has everything under control, then she finishes pulling the blinds shut, once again all business. She walks out calmly, leaving us alone in the dark, empty room.
INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
We HEAR a jazzy rendition of "DESAFINADO" under the cacophonous and oddly comforting DIN of a room full of people all talking at once.
SIGN NEAR THE DOOR READS:
GREATER ROCKWELL REALTOR RESOURCES GROUP
Well-dressed professionals stand IN clumps, chatting.Catering waiters serve hors d'eouvres. We discover Lester and Carolyn, with cocktails, MOVING through the crowd.
CAROLYNLester, listen to me. This is an important business function. Now, as you know, my business is selling an image. And part of my job is to live that image - 
LESTER(in unison with her; he's heard this before)is to live that image -(then)Just say whatever you want to say, okay? Spare me the propaganda.
CAROLYN(sighs)Will you please do me a favor and act happy tonight?
LESTER(grins stupidly)I am happy, honey.
Carolyn's jaw tightens, then:
CAROLYN(spots someone)Leonard!
She drag. LESTER toward a distinguished silver-haired MAN andhis much younger WIFE. We recognize the Man as LEONARD KANE The Real Estate King.
CAROLYN (cont'd)(shakes Leonard's hand)It's good to see you again.
LEONARD(friendly)It's good to see you too, Catherine.
CAROLYNCarolyn.
LEONARDCarolyn! Of course. How are you?
CAROLYNVery well, thank you.(to his wife)Hello, Christy.
CHRISTYHello
CAROLYNThis is my husband, Lester - 
LEONARD(shakes Lester's Hand)It's a pleasure.
LESTERWe've actually met. At this same thing last year? Wait - maybe it was that Christmas thing at the Sheraton.
LEONARDOh, yes.
LESTER(friendly)It's okay. I wouldn't remember me either.
He LAUGHS. a little too loudly. Carolyn quickly joins in.
CAROLYN(forced gaiety) Honey. Don't be weird.
She smiles her winning smile at him. He knows This personawell, only it's never pissed him off as much as it does right now.
LESTERAll right, honey. I won't be weird.
He moves IN Suddenly, his face CLOSE to hers.
LESTER (cont'd)I'll be whatever you want me to be.
And He kisses her - a soft, warm kiss THAT speaksunmistakably of sex - then turns to the others and grins.
LESTER (cont'd)We have a very healthy relationship.
Carolyn's smile is frozen on her face, and we can see just about every vein in her neck.
LESTER (cont'd)Well. I don't know about you, but I need another drink.
He crosses off. Carolyn, Leonard and Christy watch him go.
INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER
LESTER stands at the bar. the bartender pours him a scotch.
LESTERWhoa. Put a little more in there, cowboy.
The bartender complies. LESTER takes his drink and turns toface the center of the room.
His POV: Carolyn is talking to Leonard and Christy. She's on: smiling, animated, LAUGHING too loud at their jokes.
Lester smiles and shakes his head. Ricky approaches him, wearing a waiter's uniform, carrying a tray of empty glasses.
RICKYExcuse me - don't you live on Robin Hood Trail? The house with the red door?
LESTER(suspicious)Yeah.
RICKYI'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved into the house next to you.
LESTEROh. Hi, Ricky Fitts. I'm Lester Burnham.
RICKYHi, Lester Burnham.
A beat. LESTER looks away, scans the crowd, then downs therest of his drink in one gulp. Ricky just stands there, watching him. Finally Lester turns back to Ricky: what does this kid want?
RICKY (cont'd)Hey, do you party?
LESTERI'm sorry?
RICKYDo you get high? 
Lester's surprised, but instantly intrigued.
INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Carolyn and Leonard are deep IN conversation. Christy haswandered off. Carolyn is nervous; Leonard seems amused.
CAROLYNI probably wouldn't even tell you this if I weren't a little tipsy, but... I am in complete awe of you. Your firm is, hands down, the Rolls Royce of local Real Estate firms, and, well, your personal sales record is, is, is very intimidating. I'd love to sit down with you, just to pick your brain, if you'd ever be willing. I suppose, technically, I'm the competition, but... I mean, I don't flatter myself that I'm even in the same league as you...
LEONARDI'd love to.
CAROLYN(shocked)Really?
LEONARDAbsolutely. Call my secretary and have her schedule a lunch.
CAROLYNI'll do that. Thank you.
She smiles at him, and He smiles back. This situation isloaded and they both know it.
EXT. HOTEL - LATER
RICKY and LESTER stand next to a dumpster behind the serviceentrance to the hotel, smoking a JOINT.
LESTERWhat about... did you ever see that one movie, with the body walking around holding its own head? And then the head went down on that babe?
RICKYRe-Animator. It was okay.
Suddenly, the service entrance opens, and a serious YOUNG MANin a cheap suit peers out at them. Ricky hides the joint.
Suddenly, the service entrance opens, and a serious YOUNG MANin a cheap suit peers out at them. Ricky hides the joint.
MAN(to Ricky)Look. I'm not paying you to...(eyes Lester, suspiciously)...do whatever it is you're doing out here.
RICKYFine. Don't pay me.
MANExcuse me?
RICKYI quit. So you don't have to pay me. Now, leave me alone.
A beat.
MANAsshole.
He goes BACK inside. LESTER looks at RICKY, who shrugs as Hestubs out the joint.
LESTERI think you just became my personal hero.(then)Doesn't that make you nervous, just quitting your job like that? Well, I guess when you're all of, what? Sixteen?
RICKYNineteen.(off Lester's look)I was held back a few years in school. (then)I just do these gigs every now and then as a cover. I have other sources of income. But my dad interferes a lot less in my life when I pretend to be an upstanding young citizen with a respectable job.
CAROLYN (O.C.)Lester?
Carolyn is standing IN the open service entrance, staring atLester and Ricky curiously.
CAROLYN (cont'd)What are you doing?
LESTERCarolyn, this is Ricky Fitts.
RICKYHi, I just moved next door to you. I also go to school with your daughter.
LESTERWith Jane? Really?
RICKYYeah. Jane.
CAROLYNHi(then to Lester)I'm ready to leave. I'll meet you out front. 
And she goes BACK inside.
LESTERUh-oh. I'm in trouble. Well, nice to meet you, Ricky. Thanks for the, uh, thing.
RICKYAny time.
LESTER goes inside.
RICKY (cont'd)(calls after him)If you want any more, you know where I live.
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
JANE and ANGELA are watching TV. we HEAR the BACK door open.
JANEOh, God. They're home. Quick, let's go Up to my room.
JANE switches off the TV and starts UP the stairs.
ANGELAI should say hi to your dad. (off Jane's look)I don't want to be rude.
She starts toward the kitchen. JANE comes BACK down thestairs. She doesn't like this.
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
LESTER enters and opens the refrigerator, surveying thechoices inside.
ANGELA (O.C.)Nice suit.
He turns, and is instantly transfixed by:
His POV: ANGELA leans against the counter, twirling her hair.
ANGELA (cont'd)You're looking good, Mr. Burnham.(off his look)You look all relaxed. 
She starts toward him
ANGELA (cont'd)Last time I saw you, you looked kind of wound up.(spots something)Oo, is that root beer?
She reaches inside the refrigerator to grab a bottle. as shedoes, she moves to place her other hand casually on Lester's shoulder. He sees it coming. Everything SLOWS DOWN, and all sound FADES...
EXTREME CLOSE UP on her hand as it briefly touches hisshoulder in SLOW MOTION. He HEAR only the amplified BRUSH of her fingers against the fabric of his suit, and its unnatural, hollow ECHO...
BACK IN Real TIME: she grabs the root beer and looks UP athim; smiling.
CLOSE on LESTER: his eyes narrow slightly, then:
He takes the root beer from ANGELA and puts it on thecounter. Then he cups her face in his hands and kisses her roughly. She seems shocked, but doesn't resist as he pulls her toward him with surprising strength.
He breaks the kiss, looking at her IN awe, then He reaches UPand touches his lips. His eyes widen as he pulls a solitary ROSE PETAL from his mouth right before we SMASH CUT TO:
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
ANGELA is BACK against the counter, drinking the root beer.Lester stands by the refrigerator, gazing at her, still lost in his fantasy.
ANGELAI love root beer, don't you?
JANE watches from the doorway to the FAMILY ROOM, staring ather father and feeling incredibly awkward in her own home. Carolyn enter from the dining room. Lester snaps out of it and grabs a root beer from the refrigerator.
JANEMom, you remember Angela.
CAROLYN(her sales smile)Yes, of course!
JANEI forgot to tell you, she's spending the night. It that okay?
LESTERSure!He takes a sip OF his root beer, But it goes down the wrongway and he starts COUGHING violently. 
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
ANGELA lays on the bed, IN her bra and panties, flippingthrough a fashion magazine. Jane, in an oversized T shirt, plays a video game on her computer.
JANEI'm sorry about my dad.
ANGELADon't be. I think it's funny.
JANEYeah, to you, he's just another guy who wants to jump your bones. But to me... he's just too embarrassing to live.
ANGELAYour mom's the one who's embarrassing. What a phony.
JANE glances at ANGELA, irritated.
ANGELA (cont'd)But your dad is actually kind of cute.
JANEShut up.
Lester, still in his suit, stands outside Jane's room, his ear up against the door. He can't believe what he's hearing.
ANGELA (O.C.)He is. If he just worked out a little, he'd be hot.
JANE (O.C.)Shut up.
ANGELA (O.C.)Oh, come on. Haven't you ever sneaked a peek at him in his underwear?
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
ANGELAI bet he's got a big dick.
JANEYou are so grossing me out. 
ANGELA(really enjoying this)If he built up his chest and arms, I'd totally fuck him.
JANE covers her ears and starts singing to drown her out.
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Lester, still listening, looks like he's about to implode.
ANGELA (O.C.)(laughs)I would! I would suck your dad's big fat dick, and then I would fuck him 'til his eyes rolled back in his head!(then)What was that noise? Jane.
Jane's SINGING stops.
ANGELA (O.C.) (cont'd)I swear I heard something.
Panicked, LESTER scurries down the hall.
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
JANEYeah, it was the sound of you being a huge disgusting pig.
ANGELAI'm serious.
We HEAR the sharp TAP OF a penny being thrown against glass.
ANGELA (cont'd)See?
ANGELA crosses to the window and looks out.
ANGELA (cont'd)(spots something)Oh my God. Jane
EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
We see Angela standing at the window in her underwear, looking down at us. Jane joins her and is immediately unnerved by what she sees:
Their POV: In the Burnham's DRIVEWAY, the word "JANE" is spelled out in FIRE.
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
JANEWhat is it?
ANGELAIt's that psycho next door. Jane, what if he worships you? What if he's got a shrine with pictures of you surrounded by dead people's heads and stuff?

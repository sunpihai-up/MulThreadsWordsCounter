CLOSE on a COMPUTER MONITOR: We're in some sort of virtual-reality post-apocalyptic environment. Hideous armed MUTANTS approach from all angles, shooting at us. One by one, they're blown away, their heads EXPLODING in geysers of BLOOD.
LESTER (O.C.)Take that, alien bitches!
Lester sits in his cubicle at work, glued to his monitor, feverishly handling a JOYSTICK.
LESTER (cont'd)Woo-hoo!
From the surrounding cubicles, his co-workers watch blankly.
INT. BRAD'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
BRAD is seated behind his desk, reading a document. LESTERsits across from him, smiling.
BRAD(reads)...my job consists of basically masking my contempt for the assholes in charge, and, at least once a day, retiring to the men's room so I can jerk off while I fantasize about a life that doesn't so closely resemble hell.(looks up at Lester)Well, you obviously have no interest in saving yourself.
LESTER(laughs)I've spent fourteen years being a whore for the advertising industry. The only way I could save myself now is to start firebombing.
BRADWhatever. Management wants you gone by the end of the day.
LESTERWhoa. What kind of severance package is "management" prepared to give me? Considering the information I have about our editorial director buying pussy with company money.
A beat.
LESTER (cont'd)Which I'm sure would interest the I.R.S., since, technically, it does constitute fraud. And some of our advertisers and rival publications might like to know about it as well. Not to mention Craig's wife.
A beat. BRAD sighs.
BRADWhat do you want?
LESTEROne year's salary, with continued benefits.
BRADThat's not going to happen.
LESTERWhat if I throw in a little sexual harassment charge?
BRAD LAUGHS.
BRADAgainst who? 
LESTERAgainst you.
BRAD stops LAUGHING.
LESTER (cont'd)Can you prove you didn't offer to save my job if I'd let you blow me?
BRAD leans BACK IN his chair, studying Lester.
BRADMan. You are one twisted fuck.
LESTER(standing)Nope. Just an ordinary guy with nothing to lose.
LESTER starts toward the door, then:
LESTER (cont'd)I hope you and I can still be friends, Brad. And even though you didn't save my job...(smiling)You can still blow me, asshole.
And He exits.

LEONARD(bitterly)Yes, according to her1 I'm too focused on my career. As if being driven to succeed is some sort of character flaw. Of course, she certainly took advantage of the lifestyle my success afforded her(then laughing)Believe me, it's for the best.
CAROLYNBut when I saw you two at the party the other night, you seemed perfectly happy.
LEONARDWell, call me crazy, but... it's my philosophy that to actually be successful, one must project an image of success, at all times.

He trails off, as something outside catches his attention:
His POV: A FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT called SMILEY'S. The logo on the sign features a yellow SMILEY-FACE with a red tongue licking its smiling lips. Underneath it, plastic letters spell out: NOW TAKING APPLICATIONS.

A slightly overweight TEENAGE GIRL mans the counter; behind her, a couple of slow-moving teenagers work... vaguely. They all wear bright yellow uniforms and white BASEBALL CAPS which feature the SMILEY'S logo. Lester enters, straightening his tie, and crosses to the counter.
COUNTER GIRL (zombie like)Smile, you're at Smiley's Would you like to try our new bacon and egg fajita, just a dollar twenty-nine for a limited time only?

MANAGERI don't think you'd fit in here.
LESTERI have fast food experience.
MANAGERYes, like twenty years ago.
LESTERWell, I'm sure there have been amazing technological advancements in the industry, but... surely you have some sort of training process. It seems unfair to presume I won't be able to learn.
The Manger frowns, unconvinced.
LESTER (cont'd)Should you choose not to hire me, I have to assume it's because of my age, which I can only interpret as discrimination and would have to take up with my attorney.
The Manager sighs and runs an hand through his greasy hair, wondering what he could possibly have done to deserve this.

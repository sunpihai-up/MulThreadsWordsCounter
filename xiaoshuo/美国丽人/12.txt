ANGELASo you and psycho boy are fucking on a regular basis now, right?
JANE(irritable)No.
ANGELAOh, come on. You can tell me. Does he have a big dick?
JANELook, I don't want to talk about his dick with you. It's not like that.
ANGELANot like what? Doesn't he have one?(then)Jane, don't be a sap and fall for the first guy you have sex with. That is so stupid.
JANEYou know what's stupid? Only fucking people because you think it'll get you something! That's pathetic.
ANGELA rolls her eyes.
ANGELAWe gotta get you a real man.

The COLONEL stands at the sink, rinsing off his dinner plate.Something outside catches his eye, and he cranes his neck to get a better look at...
His POV: Through the window over the sink, we can see intothe Burnham's GARAGE DOOR WINDOW. Our view is slightly blurred by the pouring RAIN, but we see Lester, walking back and forth. his upper body pumped and glistening in sweat as he counts out a wad of BILLS... and then Ricky walks into view.

The Colonel's POV: Lester lets go of Ricky and dances around goofily, still laughing. Ricky sits on the bench and bends over to reach under it. From our perspective, it looks like he's untying his shoes.
The COLONEL watches, incredulous. then we HEAR a CARAPPROACHING, and the Colonel glances over at:
His POV: Angela's BMW pulls into the driveway, stopping behind Lester's GTO. As Angela and Jane get out and run toward the house, our focus MOVES back to the GARAGE DOOR WINDOW.

ANGELAWow. Look at you. Have you been working out?
LESTERSome.
JANE rolls her eyes and exits. ANGELA walks over to Lester.
ANGELAWell, you can really tell. Look at those arms.
She places her hand on his arm flirtatiously, looks UP at himand smiles, fully expecting to intimidate him by doing so. But something has changed, and he isn't intimidated at all. He looks directly back at her, leans in and smiles slowly.
LESTERYou like muscles?
His voice is low and intense, and the moment is charged witherotic tension.
ANGELA(unnerved)Uh, sure. I guess.
She moves away, Suddenly insecure.

COLONELDamn straight I do. I'd rather you were dead than be a fucking faggot.
A beat. RICKY Suddenly smiles.
RICKYYou're right. I suck dick for money. Look at this, two thousand dollars. I'm that good.
The COLONEL pushes RICKY away from him IN disgust.
COLONELGet out.
RICKYAnd you should see me fuck. I'm the best piece of ass in three states.
COLONEL(explodes)Get out!! I don't ever want to see you again!!
Ricky stands there, eyeing the Colonel. He's finally discovered a way to break free from his father, and he can't believe it was this simple.

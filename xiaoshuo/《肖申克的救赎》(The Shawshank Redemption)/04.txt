33 INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1947) 33
A DEAFENING NOISE of industrial washers and presses. Andy works the laundry line. A nightmarish job. He's new at it. BOB, the
con foreman, elbows him aside and shows him how it's done.
34 INT -- SHOWERS -- DAY (1947) 34
Shower heads mounted in bare concrete. Andy showers with a
dozen or more men. No modesty here. At least the water is good
and hot, soothing his tortured muscles.
Bogs looms from the billowing steam, smiling, checking Andy up
and down. Rooster and PETE appear from the sides. The Sisters.
BOGS
You're some sweet punk. You been broke in yet?
Andy tries to step past them. He gets shoved around, nothing serious, just some slap and tickle. Jackals sizing up prey.
BOGS
Hard to get. I like that.
Andy breaks free, flushed and shaking. He hurries off, leaving the three Sisters laughing.
35 INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 35
Andy lies staring at the darkness, unable to sleep.
36 EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- DAY (1947) 36
Exercise period. Red plays catch with Heywood and Jigger, lazily tossing a baseball around. Red notices Andy off to the side. Nods hello. Andy takes this as a cue to amble over. Heywood and Jigger pause, watching.
ANDY
(offers his hand)
Hello. I'm Andy Dufresne.
Red glances at the hand, ignores it. The game continues.
RED
The wife-killin' banker.
ANDY
How do you know that?
RED
I keep my ear to the ground. Why'd you do it?
ANDY
I didn't, since you ask.
RED
Hell, you'll fit right in, then.
(off Andy's look)
Everyone's innocent in here, don't you know that? Heywood! What are you in for, boy?
HEYWOOD
Didn't do it! Lawyer fucked me!
Red gives Andy a look. See?
ANDY
What else have you heard?
RED
People say you're a cold fish. They say you think your shit smells sweeter than ordinary. That true?
ANDY
What do you think?
RED
Ain't made up my mind yet.
Heywood nudges Jigger. Watch this. He winds up and throws the
ball hard -- right at Andy's head. Andy sees it coming out of the corner of his eye, whirls and catches it. Beat. He sends the ball right back, zinging it into Heywood's hands. Heywood drops the ball and grimaces, wringing his stung hands.
ANDY
I understand you're a man who knows how to get things.
RED
I'm known to locate certain things from time to time. They seem to
fall into my hands. Maybe it's 'cause I'm Irish.
ANDY
I wonder if you could get me a rock-hammer?
RED
What is it and why?
ANDY
You make your customers' motives a part of your business?
RED
If you wanted a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask questions. I'd just quote a price. A toothbrush, see, is a non-lethal sort of object.
ANDY
Fair enough. A rock-hammer is about eight or nine inches long. Looks like a miniature pickaxe, with a small sharp pick on one end, and a blunt hammerhead on the other. It's for rocks.
RED
Rocks.
Andy squats, motions Red to join him. Andy grabs a handful of dirt and sifts it through his hands. He finds a pebble and rubs it clean. It has a nice milky glow. He tosses it to Red.
RED
Quartz?
ANDY
Quartz, sure. And look. Mica. Shale. Silted granite. There's some graded limestone, from when they cut this place out of the hill.
RED
So?
ANDY
I'm a rockhound. At least I was, in my old life. I'd like to be again,
on a limited scale.
RED
Yeah, that or maybe plant your toy in somebody's skull?
ANDY
I have no enemies here.
RED
No? Just wait.
Red flicks his gaze past Andy. Bogs is watching them.
RED
Word gets around. The Sisters have taken a real shine to you, yes they have. Especially Bogs.
ANDY
Tell me something. Would it help if I explained to them I'm not
homosexual?
RED
Neither are they. You have to be human first. They don't qualify.
(off Andy's look)
Bull queers take by force, that's all they want or understand. I'd
grow eyes in the back of my head if I were you.
ANDY
Thanks for the advice.
RED
That comes free. But you understand my concern.
ANDY
If there's trouble, I doubt a rock- hammer will do me any good.
RED
Then I guess you wanna escape. Tunnel under the wall maybe?
(Andy laughs politely)
I miss the joke. What's so funny?
ANDY
You'll know when you see the rock- hammer.
RED
What's this item usually go for?
ANDY
Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.
RED
My standard mark-up's twenty percent, but we're talkin' about a
special object. Risk goes up, price goes up. Call it ten bucks even.
ANDY
Ten it is.
RED
I'll see what I can do.
(rises, slapping dust)
But it's a waste of money.
ANDY
Oh?
RED
Folks who run this place love surprise inspections. They turn a blind eye to some things, but not a gadget like that. They'll find it, and you'll lose it. Mention my name, we'll never do business again. Not for a pair of shoelaces or a stick of gum.
ANDY
I understand. Thank you, Mr...?
RED
Red. The name's Red.
ANDY
Red. I'm Andy. Pleasure doing business with you.
They shake. Andy strolls off. Red watches him go.
RED (V.O.)
I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby. He had a quiet way about him, a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around
here. He strolled. like a man in a park without a care or worry. Like
he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place.
(resumes playing catch)
Yes, I think it would be fair to say I liked Andy from the start.
37 INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1947) 37
Red gets his breakfast and heads for a table. Andy falls in step, slips him a tightly-folded square of paper.
38 INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 38
Lying on his bunk, Red unfolds the square. A ten dollar bill.
RED (V.O.)
He was a man who adapted fast.
39 EXT -- LOADING DOCK -- DAY (1947) 39
Under watchful supervision, CONS are off-loading bags of dirty
laundry from an "Eliot Nursing Home" truck.
RED (V.O.)
Years later, I found out he'd brought in quite a bit more than just ten dollars...
A certain bag hits the ground. The TRUCK DRIVER shoots a look
at a black con, LEONARD, then ambles over to a GUARD to shoot
the shit. Leonard loads the bag onto a cart...
40 INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1947) 40
Bags are being unloaded. We find Leonard working the line.
RED (V.O.)
When they check you into this hotel, one of the bellhops bends you over and looks up your works, just to make sure you're not carrying anything. But a truly determined man can get an object quite a ways up there.
Leonard slips a small paper-wrapped package out of the laundry bag, hides it under his apron, and keeps sorting...
4l INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY EXCHANGE -- DAY (1947) 41
Red deposits his dirty bundle and moves down the line to where the clean sheets are being handed out.
RED (V.O.)
That's how Andy joined our happy little Shawshank family with more
than five hundred dollars on his person. Determination.
Leonard catches Red's eye, turns and grabs a specific stack of clean sheets. He hands it across to Red --
TIGHT ANGLE
-- and more than clean laundry changes hands. Two packs of cigarettes slide out of Red's hand into Leonard's.
42 INT -- RED'S CELL -- DAY (1947) 42
Red slips the package out of his sheets, carefully checks to make sure nobody's coming, then rips it open. He pulls out the rock-hammer. It's just as Andy described. Red laughs softly.
RED (V.O.)
Andy was right. I finally got the joke. It would take a man about six
hundred years to tunnel under the wall with one of these.

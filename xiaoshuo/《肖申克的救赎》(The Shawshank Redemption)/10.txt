130 INT -- BATHROOM -- DAY (1955) 130 
Wiley sits in one of the stalls, Jughead comic on his knees.
131 INT -- GUARD STATION/OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1955) 131
Andy wrestles the phonograph player onto the guards' desk,
sweeping things onto the floor in his haste. He plugs the machine in. A red light warms up. The platter starts spinning.
He slides the Mozart album from its sleeve, lays it on the platter, and lowers the tone arm to his favorite cut. The needle HISSES in the groove...and the MUSIC begins, lilting and gorgeous. Andy sinks into Wiley's chair, overcome by its beauty. It is "Deutino: Che soave zeffiretto," a duet sung by
Susanna and the Contessa.
132 INT -- BATHROOM -- DAY (1955) 132
Wiley pauses reading, puzzled. He thinks he hears music.
WILEY
Andy? You hear that?
133 INT -- GUARD STATION/OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1955) 133
Andy shoots a look at the bathroom...and smiles. Go for broke.
He lunges to his feet and barricades the front door, then the
bathroom. He returns to the desk and positions the P.A.
microphone. He works up his courage, then flicks all the
toggles to "on." A SQUEAL OF FEEDBACK echoes briefly...
134 INT/EXT -- VARIOUS P.A. SPEAKERS -- DAY (1955) 134
...and the Mozart is suddenly broadcast all over the prison.
135 INT -- BATHROOM -- DAY (1955) 135
Wiley lunges to his feet, pants tangling around his ankles.
136 INT/EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- VARIOUS LOCATIONS -- DAY (1955) 136
Cons all over the prison stop whatever they're doing, freezing in mid-step to listen, gazing up at the speakers.
137 The stamping machines in the plate shop are shut down... 137
138 The laundry line goes silent, grinding to a halt... 138
139 The wood shop machines are turned off, buzzing to a stop... 139
140 The motor pool...the kitchen...the loading dock...the exercise 140
thru yard...the numbing routine of prison life itself...all grinds thru
143 to a stuttering halt. Nobody moves, nobody speaks. Everybody 143
just stands in place, listening to the MUSIC, hypnotized.
144 INT -- GUARD STATION -- DAY (1955) 144
Andy is reclined in the chair, transported, arms fluidly conducting the music. Ecstasy and rapture. Shawshank no longer exists. It has been banished from the mind of men.
145 EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- DAY (1955) 145
CAMERA TRACKS along groups of men, all riveted.
RED (V.O.)
I have no idea to this day what them two Italian ladies were singin' about. Truth is, I don't want to know. Some things are best left unsaid. I like to think they were singin' about something so beautiful it can't be expressed in words, and makes your heart ache because of it.
CAMERA brings us to Red.
RED (V.O.)
I tell you, those voices soared. Higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream. It was like some beautiful bird flapped
into our drab little cage and made these walls dissolve away...and for
the briefest of moments -- every last man at Shawshank felt free.
146 INT -- PRISON CORRIDOR -- DAY (1955) 146
FAST DOLLY with Norton striding up the hallway with Hadley.
RED (V.O.)
It pissed the warden off something terrible.
147 INT -- GUARD STATION/OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1955) 147
Norton and Hadley break the door in. Andy looks up with a
sublime smile. We hear Wiley POUNDING on the bathroom door:
WILEY (O.S.)
LET ME OUUUUT!
148 INT -- SOLITARY WING -- DAY (1955) 148
LOW ANGLE SLOW PUSH IN on the massive, rust-streaked steel
door. God, this is a terrible place to be.
RED (V.O.)
Andy got two weeks in the hole for that little stunt.
149 INT -- SOLITARY CONFINEMENT -- DAY (1955) 149
Andy doesn't seem to mind. His arms sweep to the music still
playing in his head. We hear a FAINT ECHO of the soaring duet.
150 INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1955) 1 50
HEYWOOD
Couldn't play somethin' good, huh? Hank Williams?
ANDY
They broke the door down before I could take requests.
FLOYD
Was it worth two weeks in the hole?
ANDY
Easiest time I ever did.
HEYWOOD
Shit. No such thing as easy time in the hole. A week seems like a year.
ANDY
I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company. Hardly felt the time at all.
RED
Oh, they let you tote that record player down there, huh? I could'a
swore they confiscated that stuff.
ANDY
(taps his heart, his head)
The music was here...and here. That's the one thing they can't
confiscate, not ever. That's the beauty of it. Haven't you ever felt
that way about music, Red?
RED
Played a mean harmonica as a younger man. Lost my taste for it. Didn't make much sense on the inside.
ANDY
Here's where it makes most sense. We need it so we don't forget.
RED
Forget?
ANDY
That there are things in this world not carved out of gray stone. That
there's a small place inside of us they can never lock away, and that
place is called hope.
RED
Hope is a dangerous thing. Drive a man insane. It's got no place here.
Better get used to the idea.
ANDY
(softly)
Like Brooks did?
FADE TO BLACK
151 AN IRON-BARRED DOOR 151
slides open with an enormous CLANG. A stark room beyond.
CAMERA PUSHES through. SEVEN HUMORLESS MEN sit at a long
table. An empty chair faces them. We are again in:
INT -- SHAWSHANK HEARINGS ROOM -- DAY (1957)
Red enters, ten years older than when we first saw him at a parole hearing. He removes his cap and sits.
MAN #l
It says here you've served thirty years of a life sentence.
MAN #2
You feel you've been rehabilitated?
RED
Yes sir, without a doubt. I can say I'm a changed man. No danger to
society, that's the God's honest truth. Absolutely rehabilitated.
CLOSEUP -- PAROLE FORM
A big rubber stamp slams down: "REJECTED."
152 EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DUSK (1957) 152
Red emerges into fading daylight. Andy's waiting for him.
RED
Same old, same old. Thirty years. Jesus. When you say it like that...
ANDY
You wonder where it went. I wonder where ten years went.
Red nods, solemn. They settle in on the bleachers. Andy pulls a small box from his sweater, hands it to Red.
ANDY
Anniversary gift. Open it.
Red does. Inside the box, on a thin layer of cotton, is a shiny new harmonica, bright aluminum and circus-red.
ANDY
Had to go through one of your competitors. Hope you don't mind.
Wanted it to be a surprise.
RED
It's very pretty, Andy. Thank you.
ANDY
You gonna play something?
--
Red considers it, shakes his head. Softly:
RED
Not today.
153 INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE/ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1957) 153
Men line the tiers as the evening count is completed. The convicts step into their cells. The master switch is thrown and all the doors slam shut -- KA-THUMP! Andy finds a cardboard tube on his bunk. The note reads: "A new girl for your 10 year anniversary. From your pal. Red."
154 INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- LATER (1957) 154
Marilyn Monroe's face fills the screen. SLOW PULL BACK reveals
the new poster: the famous shot from "The Seven Year Itch," on the subway grate with skirt billowing up. Andy sits gazing at her as lights-out commences...
INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1957) 155
...and we find Red gazing blankly as darkness takes the cellblock. Adding up the months, weeks, days...
He regards the harmonica like a man confronted with a Martian artifact. He considers trying it out -- even holds it briefly to his lips, almost embarrassed -- but puts it back in its box untested. And there the harmonica will stay...
FADE TO BLACK
156 WE HOLD IN BLACKNESS as THUMPING SOUNDS grow louder... 156
RED (V.O.)
Andy was as good as his word. He kept writing to the State Senate.
Two letters a week instead of one.
...and the BLACKNESS disintegrates as a wall tumbles before our eyes, revealing a WORK CREW with picks and sledgehammers,
faces obscured outlaw-style with kerchiefs against the dust. Behind them are GUARDS overseeing the work.
Andy yanks his kerchief down, grinning in exhilaration. Red and the others follow suit. They step through the hole in the wall, exploring what used to be a sealed-off storage room.
RED (V.O.)
In 1959, the folks up Augusta way finally clued in to the fact they
couldn't buy him off with just a 200 dollar check. Appropriations
Committee voted an annual payment of 500 dollars, just to shut him up.
157 INT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- DAY (1960) 157
TRACKING the construction. Walls have been knocked down. Men
are painting, plastering, hammering. Lots of shelves going up.
Red is head carpenter. We find him discussing plans with Andy.
RED (V.O.)
Those checks came once a year like clockwork.
158 INT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- DAY (1960) 158
Red and the boys are opening boxes, pulling out books.
RED (V.O.)
You'd be amazed how far Andy could stretch it. He made deals with book clubs, charity groups...he bought remaindered books by the pound...
HEYWOOD
Treasure Island. Robert Louis...
ANDY
(jotting)
...Stevenson. Next?
RED
I got here an auto repair manual, and a book on soap carving.
ANDY
Trade skills and hobbies, those go under educational. Stack right
behind you.
HEYWOOD
The Count of Monte Crisco...
FLOYD
Cristo, you dumbshit.
HEYWOOD
...by Alexandree Dumb-ass.
ANDY
Dumas. You boys'll like that one.
It's about a prison break.
Floyd tries to take the book. Heywood yanks it back. I saw it
first. Red shoots Andy a look.
RED
Maybe that should go under educational too.

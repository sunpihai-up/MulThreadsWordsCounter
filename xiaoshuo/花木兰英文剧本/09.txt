Shang [from mounted horse]: Search for survivors. 
[Cut to Mulan walking around the burned-out village. She finds a the doll that Shan-Yu was holding and looks up sorrowfully. Shangcomes to her side]
Shang: I don't understand. My father should have been here.
[Zoom in on the fireworks tower. Mushu lands near Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft (the fireworklighters) on the edge of the tower] 
Mushu: Citizens, I need firepower.
Barry Cook: Who are you?
Mushu [Mushu (using the wings from the kite) and Cri-Kee with wings spread like batman]: You'reworst nightmare.
[Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft jump off the tower and plunge toward the ground]
[Cut to Mulan. She pulls herself onto the roof and climbs up to the crest]
Man in Crowd #1: On the roof.
Man in Crowd #2: Look!
[Mulan lines up where she is standing with the fireworks tower across the way. Shan-Yu breaksthrough the roof behind Mulan surprising her. Mulan backs away and searches for something on herperson to help her against Shan-Yu. She finds a her fan, takes it out, and opens it]
Shan-Yu: It looks like you're out of ideas.
[Shan-Yu lunges with his sword. Mulan dodges to her right and lets the sword go right throughthe fan. She closes the fan back up on the sword and twists the fan with both hands so thatShan-Yu loses his grip. The sword flies toward Mulan and she catches it by the handle slippingoff the fan with her sword movement]
Mulan: Not quite. [calling out] Ready, Mushu?
Mushu [behind Shan-Yu tied to a large rocket firework]: I am ready, baby. [He blows fire onto astick and hands the stick to Cri-Kee who's standing on the firework] Light me! [Cri-Kee lightsthe fuse]
[Shan-Yu approaches Mulan. Using the sword as a lever, Mulan lunges at Shan-Yu kicking him inthe face then sweep kicks him and he falls to the ground. Mulan picks the sword back up andstabs it into Shan-Yu's cape. The rocket on Mushu ignites and hurls him toward Shan-Yu. Mulanlies flat down on the left side of the roof. Shan-Yu sees the approaching rocket and tries torun, but the sword has him pinned to the spot. The rocket hits Shan-Yu square in the bellypropelling him toward the firework tower. Mushu grabbed onto the sword as he went by letting therocket do the work. Cri-Kee hangs on to Mushu's tail. Mulan jumps back up to the crest of theroof and runs away from the fireworks tower grabbing Mushu and Cri-Kee off the sword]
Mulan [while running]: Get off the roof, get off the roof, get off the roof.
[The rocket rides Shan-Yu into the fireworks tower causing masses of explosions and fireworks tofly everywhere. Mulan jumps near the edge of the roof. Propelled by the explosion, she grabsonto a lantern that is hanging on a taught rope and starts to slide down. She looks down andreleases her grip so that she lands on the back of Shang causing the two of them to fall to theground. Shan-Yu's sword follows and lands on the ground near by]
Mushu [landing and flying backwards on his butt a couple of times pointing at the fireworks]: Ahha ha ha ha. [Mushu's catches Cri-Kee with antenna on fire as Cri-Kee falls toward him] [toCri-Kee] You are a lucky bug. [Mushu pinches out the fire on Cri-Kee's antenna]
Chi Fu [walking down the stairs in a tattered outfit and slightly burned]: That was a deliberateattempt on my life. Where is she? Now she's done it. What a mess. [Shang and troops pushMulan behind them to protect her] [to Shang] Stand aside, that creature's not worth protecting.
Shang [in Chi Fu's face]: She's a hero.
Chi Fu: 'Tis a woman. She will never be worth anything.
Shang [grabbing Chi Fu by the shirt collar]: Listen, you pompous--
Emperor [walking down the steps]: That is enough!
Shang: Your Majesty, I can explain.
[The Emperor motions for Shang to stand aside. Shang and his men part giving the Emperor a clearpath to Mulan. Mulan steps forward and bows before the Emperor. Chi Fu with a sinister lookwaits to write down the words of the Emperor]
Emperor: I've heard a great deal about you, Fa Mulan. You stole your father's armor, ran awayfrom home, impersonated a soldier, deceived your commanding officer, dishonored the Chinese army,destroyed my palace, AND...you have saved us all. [the Emperor bows to Mulan]
[Chi Fu looks at the Emperor actions astonishingly then immediately falls prostrate before Mulan. Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po follow suit. Mulan looks up then turns around hardly believingwhat she sees as the entire Chinese population within the palace grounds fall prostrate on theground in a wave like pattern, bowing to her. Khan bows with Mushu and Cri-Kee on his back]
Mushu: My little baby's all grown up and savin' China. [to Cri-Kee] You have a tissue?
Emperor: Chi Fu,
Chi Fu: Your Excellency?
Emperor: See to it that this woman is made a member of my council.
Chi Fu [muttering to himself]: A member of your coun...[realizing what the Emperor has said]what? [stutters] But there are no council positions open, your Majesty.
Emperor [to Mulan]: Very well then, you can have his job [pointing out Chi Fu].
Chi Fu [wobbling to and fro]: What?...My...[faints]
Mulan [smiles big then turns to the Emperor and bows]: With all due respect, your Excellency. Ihave been away from home long enough.
Emperor [taking off his pendant]: Then take this, so your family will know what you have donefor me. And this [handing her the sword of Shan-Yu] so the world will know what you have donefor China.
[Mulan takes the gifts and hugs the Emperor]
Yao: Is she allowed to do that? [Shang, Ling, and Chien-Po shrug]
[Mulan walks away from the Emperor and is embraced by Yao and Ling. Chien-Po comes up and liftsall three of them off the ground in a big bear hug. Chien-Po lets them all back to the groundagain. Mulan walks toward Shang and stops in front of him. As Shang begins to speak Mulanstarts to smile anticipating something good]
Shang: Um...[Mulan grins] You... [Mulan smiles] You fight good.
Mulan [smile turning into disappointment]: Oh, thank you. [Mulan walks toward Khan]
Shang: [turning toward Mulan and grunts with disappointment in himself]: Hmm.
[Mulan mounts Khan]
Mulan: Khan, let's go home.
[Khan jumps down the steps and gallops on the flat parts of the stair case back down to groundlevel. The crowd cheers al the while. The Emperor approaches Shang and clears his throat]
Emperor [to Shang]: The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all.
Shang [dumbfounded]: Sir?
Emperor: You don't meet a girl like that ev'ry dynasty. [The emperor puts on his hat and walksback up the steps to his palace]

Mulan: Father, I brought you the sword of Shan-Yu [hands the sword to Fa Zhou] and the crest ofthe Emperor [hands the crest to Fa Zhou]. [with head bowed] They're gifts to honor the FaFamily.
[Fa Zhou takes the gifts and throws them down to the ground beside him to the surprise of Mulan. He bends down and holds her arms outstretched]
Fa Zhou: The greatest gift and honor, is having you for a daughter. [Fa Zhou wipes away Mulan'stear then hugs Mulan] I've missed you so.
Mulan: I've missed you too Baba.
[Fa li and Grandma Fa watch from the doorway]
Fa Li [sighing]: Ahhhhh
Grandma Fa: Great, she brings home a sword. If you ask me she should have brought home ama--[leaving her mouth open when she sees Shang]
Shang [just arriving]: Excuse me, does Fa Mulan live here?
[Grandma Fa's mouth stays open as she and Fa Li point toward Mulan's position. Shang walkstoward Mulan and Fa Zhou]
Grandma Fa: Woo, sign me up for the next war.
[Shang approaches seeing Fa Zhou]
Shang [bows before Fa Zhou and speaks confidently]: Honorable Fa Zhou I--Mulan [Mulan steps up. Shang sees her and speaks insecurely] Uh...Uh...You forgot your helmet. Ah but well, actuallyit's your helmet, isn't it?...[handing the helmet toward Fa Zhou] I mean...
[Fa Zhou motions with his head for Mulan to take over. Mulan holds the helmet Shang offers]

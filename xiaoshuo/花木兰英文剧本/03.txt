[Mushu appears as a giant shadow being cast on a rock with flames on eitherside. Mushu's real appearance remains out of sight]
Mushu [in a Southern Baptist Preacher's voice]: Did I hear someone ask for amiracle!? Let me hear you say aye!

Mulan: You're uh...
Mushu: Intimidating? Awe inspiring?
Mulan [making a hand gesture to denote his smallness of size]: Tiny.
Mushu [with a look of disappointment]: Of course. I'm travel size for yourconvenience. If I was my real size, your cow here [patting Khan on the nose]would die of fright. [Khan tries to bite Mushu] [pointing to the groundspeaking to Khan] Down Bessy. My powers are beyond your mortal imagination. For instance, [leaning in and looking at Mulan's chest] my eyes can seestraight through your armor. [Mulan cover her bust with her left arm andslaps Mushu with the right] Ow. [angrily] All right, that's it! Dishonor! Dishonor on your whole family. [aside to Cri-Kee] Make a note of this[Cri-Kee grabs a leaf and a pen and starts writing]. [Loudly with gusto]Dishonor on you.

Mulan walks into a tent and sees a man picking his nose andanother man picking out dirt from between his toes with chopsticks] Beautifulisn't it?
Mulan [making a face of disgust and continuing to walk]: They're disgusting.
Mushu: No, they're men. And you're going to have to act just like them, sopay attention.
[Mulan stops and watches Yao, Ling, Chien-Po and Tattoo Soldier]
Tattoo Soldier [showing the dragon tattoo on his chest and belly]: Look, thistattoo will protect me from harm.
[Yao thinks for a moment, then punches Tattoo Soldier in the stomach causingLing to laugh. Mulan watches in utter amazement. Yao kisses his hand]
Ling [laughing]: I hope you can get your money back.
Mulan: I don't think I can do this.
Mushu: It's all attitude. Be tough like this guy here [looking at Yao].
[Mulan looks at Yao as he hocks up a loogie and spits]
Yao [noticing Mulan watching him]: What are you looking at?
Mushu: Punch him, it's how men say 'hello.'
[Mulan looks at her fist, then punches Yao from behind on the shoulder. Theforce causes Yao to run into Chien-Po]
Chien-Po: Oh Yao, you made a friend.

[Yao grabs Mulan by the collar cocking back his arm to punch. Mulan ducks asYao hits Ling standing behind her]
Yao: Oh, sorry Ling. Hey!
[Yao grabs Mulan's foot as she starts to crawl away. Ling kicks Yao on the butt causing him to land on Chien-Po's stomach. Ling Jumpattacks Mulan, but she ducks and he lands on Yao on top of Chien-Po]
Ling: You're dead. [They fight on top of Chien-Po. Mulan runs away. Ling notices Mulan and then points toward her] Oh, there he goes.
[Mulan runs into a tent and stops. Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po (in that order) run through the tent. Yao stops short as he is about to run into asoldier in a line for food. He looks behind him with concerned eyes as Ling stops in time. Chien-Po bumps into Ling causing the entire lineof soldiers to fall forward and knock over the pot of congee and the cook behind it. The men look to the back of the line and spy Mulan whohas emerged from the tent. They angrily start walking towards her. Mulan has a look of horror on her face as if trouble is about to brew]
Mulan: Hey guys. 
[Chi Fu watches and then walks into the tent. General Li and Li Shang are in the tent.]
General Li [motioning with his pointer to a map of the region]: The Huns have struck here, here and here. I will take the main troops up tothe Tung Shao Pass and stop Shan-Yu before he destroys this village.

Shang: Captain?
Chi Fu: Oh, this is an enormous responsibility, General. Uh, perhaps a soldier with more experience--
General Li: Number one in his class, extensive knowledge of training techniques, [leaning back smugly stroking his chin] an impressivemilitary lineage. I believe Li Shang will do an excellent job.
Shang [excitedly]: Oh, I will. I wont let you down. This is, I mean, I...[somberly] yes sir.
General Li [gets up and starts walking out of the tent]: Very good then. We'll toast China's victory at the Imperial City. [to Chi Fu] I'llexpect a full report in three weeks.
Chi Fu [to Shang]: And I wont leave anything out. [exits through the tent]
Shang [while tying his sword to his uniform]: Captain Li Shang, Hmmm, leader of China's finest troops. No, the greatest troops of all time. Heh, heh, heh, heh. [Shang walks out of the tent to see the recruits fighting. He stands stage left of Chi Fu and General Li. Injured Recruitsees the General and salutes him as he falls to the ground. General Li steps over Injured Recruit and mounts his horse]
Chi Fu: Most impressive.
General Li: Good luck Captain. [The general and his mounted troops leave the camp]

Chi Fu [smirking, with board and brush in hand]: Day one.
Shang [shouting]: Soldiers!
All Recruits [backing away revealing Mulan and pointing at her. Mulan is crouching in the fetal position on the ground]: He started it!

Shang [to Mulan]: I don't need anyone causing trouble in my camp!
Mulan: Sorry, [in her man voice] Uhh, I mean, sorry you had to see that. [with her fist she taps Shang on the shoulder] You know how it iswhen you get those, uh [pounding her chest] manly urges and you just have to kill something [slapping her hand], fix things, uh, cookoutdoors.

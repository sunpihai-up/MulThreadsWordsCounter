Chi Fu [calling out from the top of a hill overlooking a valley]: Captain! 
[Chi Fu points down to the valley where the remains of General Li's army can be seen. Flags poking up out of the snow, armor lying facedown, broken cannon carts. Ling, Yao, Mulan, and a soldier have the look of horror on their faces as they look into the valley. Chien-Powalks up from the valley carrying a helmet]
Chien-po [handing the helmet to Shang]: ...the General.
[Shang takes the helmet and walks to the edge of the hill. He draws his sword and stabs it into the snow upright. He kneels down andplaces the helmet on top of the sword. Mulan approaches him from behind]
Mulan [softly]: I'm sorry.
[Shang gets up, turns around and puts his hand on Mulan's shoulder and he walks by. Shang walks to the center of the troops. He grabs hishorse by the saddle, takes one quick look of grief then mounts his horse]
Shang: The Huns are moving quickly. We'll make better time to the Imperial City through the Tung Shao Pass. We're the only hope for theEmperor now. Move out!
[Mulan looks at the sword, takes out the doll she found and places the doll at the base of the sword. She turns around and joins the rest ofthe troops marching on]
[Cut to Mulan standing next to Khan saddled to the cart with cannons. A cannon blast shoots out of the cart and explodes in the air. Thetroops look surprised. Mulan glances back with a scowl into the hole in the canopy of the cart to see Mushu with a sorrowful face. Mushupoints at Cri-Kee. Shang charges up to Mulan on his horse, Chi Fu right behind]
Shang [angrily]: What happened?!
Mulan [stumbling]: Uhhh--
Shang: You just gave away our position. Now we're--[an arrow hits Shang in the shoulder as he falls to the ground. Shang pulls out thearrow] [calling out] Get out of range!!
[The troops hurriedly run away as many arrows start falling all around them. Mulan pulls Khan by the reins to hurry him up. Fire arrowsstart hitting the cart with cannons attached to Khan. The cart begins to blaze with fire]
Shang: Save the cannons!
[The troops form a human chain and start taking the cannons out of the burning cart one by one while Mulan steadies Khan to keep himfrom bolting. Chien-Po grabs many and hauls them on his own. The troops grab]as many cannons as they safely can and Mulan cuts Khanfree from the cart. She mounts Khan and charges away from the fire. The cart explodes sending Mulan flying off Khan losing her helmetand sword which land near her. Mushu and Cri-Kee, sent flying by the blast, scream and land near Mulan.
Mushu: Oh sure, save the horse.
[Mulan grabs Mushu with her right hand and grabs the sword with her left and runs to the troops position. Cri-Kee and Khan follow. Yao,Ling, Chien-Po and other recruits set up cannons against rocks. They dodge a set of arrows that fall around them]
Shang: Fire!
[They launch a volley at the mountain where the archers are stationed. As the cannon fire explodes, Shan-Yu's army hides]
Shang: Fire!
[Mulan, Ling and Chien-Po launch a second volley at the mountain where the archers are stationed. No more arrows can be seen comingfrom the mountain position]
Shang: Hold the last cannon. [Yao poised to light his cannon, pauses. Shan-Yu and his troops appear at the top of the mountain] Prepareto fight. If we die, we die with honor.
[Shan-Yu raises his sword high above his head and charges down the mountain at Shang's position. His falcon flies off his shoulder onShan-Yu's war cry The Hun army follows]
Shang: Yao, aim the cannon at Shan-Yu.
[The line of Shang's troops with Mulan at the end draw their swords. Mulan looks down at her sword and sees the reflection of a large snowembankment hanging to the side of a cliff. She rushes forward]
Yao [being pushed aside by Mulan as she grabs the cannon]: Hey. Shang: Ping, come back. Ping!
[Mulan charges forward towards the oncoming horde of the Hun army being led by Shan-Yu and his falcon. Mushu looks over her at theoncoming horde with worry in his eyes]
Shang [starting to run after her waving his arms]: Stop!
[Mulan plants the cannon and aims it for the cliff with the snow overhang]
Mushu [seeing Shan-Yu riding closer to their position]: All right, you might want to light that right about now. Quickly! Quickly!
[Mulan takes out the flint and tries to light the fuse. Shan-Yu's falcon swoops buy knocking Mulan down scattering the flint rock]
Yao [speaking to Ling and Chien-Po]: C'mon, we've gotta help. [they charge towards Mulan's position]
[Mulan searches for the flint in the snow in vain. She sees Mushu, grabs him and stretches him causing him to light the fuse. Mushu landson the cannon and the cannon fires off just above the charging Shan-Yu]
Mushu [tailing off as he rides the cannon toward the snow embankment]: You missed him! How could you miss? He was three feet infront of you!
[The cannon lodges in the snow and explodes causing the beginning of a large avalanche. Mulan looks up with an evil grin on her face andShan-Yu watches in horror as many of his troops begin to be swallowed up by the snow]
Shan-Yu [recollecting himself and focusing in on Mulan]: Yrrrrrrraah. 
[Shan-Yu swipes at Mulan with his sword hitting her in the right side. Mulan falls back grabbing her right side. Shan-Yu's horse stumbles. Mulan uses this break to bolt away from the avalanche. Shan-Yu gains his composure and starts to gallop away from the avalanche on hishorse. Shang looks with shock as hee sees the avalanche coming toward him. Mulan grabs Shang as she passes by him, turning himaround and helping him run away from the avalanche]
Yao, Chien-Po and Ling [running towards the oncoming avalanche]: Yeeahhhhhh! [they stop. noticing the oncoming avalanche they turnaround and run back to where they came from] Waaaaaaaaaa!
[Khan jumps away from the troops position and starts to run towards Mulan passing Ling, Yao and Chien-Po. The avalanche swallows upShan-Yu and his horse. Khan arrives at Mulan's position just ahead of the avalanche. Mulan jumps onto Khan and reaches for Shang. Shegrabs his hand, then the avalanche rushes forth breaking their grip, turning Khan around facing the oncoming avalanche of snow]
[Cut to Ling, Yao and Chien-Po standing behind a rock. They see the snow approaching close and run to larger shelter where the rest ofShang's army is positioned just as the avalance reaches their posision]
[Cut to Mushu riding down the snow on a shield]
Mushu [calling out]: Mulan! Mulan! [seeing hair sticking up from the snow] Mulan? [Mushu picks up the Hun by the hair]
Hun Soldier: Arrrrr.
Mushu [pushing the hun soldier back under the snow]: Nope. Mulan! [Mushu picks up Cri-Kee out of the snow] Man, you are one luckybug.
[Cut to Mulan riding Khan above the snow into the teeth of the avalanche. Khan and Mulan are swept under by the snow and reemergequickly. She looks back and sees Shang passed out riding the wave of snow]

[Cut to Mulan and Shang on Khan with Mushu and Cri-Kee riding up to her on his shield]
Mushu [riding on the shield up to Mulan, Khan and Shang speaking loudly, above the noise of the avalanche]: Hey Mulan, I found a luckycricket.
Mulan [speaking loudly]: We need help! [Yao's arrow lands near by Mulan and she picks it up and starts to tie the rope to Khan]
Mushu [Getting off the shield and carrying Cri-Kee with him]: Ooo, nice, very nice, you can sit by me. [Mushu sees that they're about to fallover the cliff. He and Cri-Kee look frightened] Ahhhhh! We're gonna die! We're gonna die! I know we're gonna die! No way we cansurvive this! Death is coming! [Mulan knocks the arrow and shoots it toward Yao]
Yao [crying]: I let them slip through my fingers. [Mulan's arrow lands in Yao's hands. He grabs on and is pulled toward the cliff, the soldiersgrab onto Yao and hold him steady near the cliff edge with the rope taught over the cliff]
Yao: Pull

Shang: Ping, what's wrong? [Mulan removes her hand slightly to show the blood on her hand and seeping through the armour] [loudly] He's wounded, get help! [Ping starts to pass out. The images of Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po begin to fade as she loses consciousness] Ping, hold on. Hold on.
[Cut to outside of the medic tent. Mulan and Medic are inside. Shang stands by the entrance. Yao, Ling and Chien-Po look quiteconcerned. Ling drums his fingers on his knees. The medic comes out from the tent and whispers to Shang. Shang looks astonished andgoes into the tent. Mulan is lying down. She opens her eyes, sees Shang and smiles at the sight of him.

[Mulan, Yao, Ling and Chien-Po walk out smiling, giggling and trying to act lady-like including holding fans and waving fans]
Hun Archer: Who's there?
Hun Bald Man #2 [putting down Hun Bald Man #1's sword]: Concubines.
Hun Bald Man #1: Ugly concubines.
Ling [waving daintily, speaking to Yao]: Oh he's so cute.
[Hun Bald Man #2 smiles and waves back. Hun Bald Man #1 elbows Hun Bald Man #2. A bitten apple falls out from beneath Ling'sdress. He pulls the dress out and turns so as not to expose the loss of figure]
Shang [from around the corner putting his head down into his hand]: Aww.
[Shan-Yu's Falcon sees Shang and starts to squawk. Mushu from above singes off all his feathers with his fire breathing]
Mushu [to Cri-Kee sitting above him]: Now that's what I call Mongolian Barbeque. [Cri-Kee rolls on his back in laughter. The stunnedfalcon doesn't do anything]
[Hun Bald Man #2 picks up the apple and offers it back to Ling. Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po pull out the fruit they were using to simulate awoman's chest. Chien-Po takes his watermelons and smashes them on the heads of Hun Bald Man #1 and #2. He then smashes their twoheads together and they fall to the ground. Ling pushes the apple into Hun Long-Hair man's mouth and kicks him in the stomach causingHun Long-Hair Man to stoop over on the ground. Ling uses his head to crack Hun Long-Hair Man's back. Hun Strong Guy lunges his fistat Yao and misses, he misses with the other. Yao grabs the outstretched arm and flips him over onto his head. Mulan kicks away HunArcher Man's bow and knocked arrow, avoids his strike by turning her back to Hun Archer. She follows with a left elbow to the stomachfollowed by a left upper cut knocking Hun Archer to the ground. She sits on his back and uses the bow to pull his head back]
Mulan [calling out]: Shang, GO!
[Shang runs out from behind the corner, charges through the door and runs up the stairs]
[Cut to Shan-Yu and the Emperor on the balcony]
Shan-Yu: I tire of your arrogance old man. [yelling and putting his sword at the emperor'sthroat] Bow to me!
Emperor: No matter how the wind howls, the mountain cannot bow to it.
Shan-Yu: Then you will kneel in pieces. [Shan-Yu draws back his sword to strike the Emperor]
[Shang runs up in time to block the striking blow of Shan-Yu with his sword. Shang swipes withhis sword. Shan-Yu grabs Shang's arm and throws him towards the edge. Shang grabs onto a columnand he flies over the edge and uses the momentum to swing back and kick Shan-Yu. Shan-Yu fallsto the ground, Shang on top of him. Shang punches Shan-Yu.

Mulan: Chien-Po, get the Emperor.
Chien-Po [standing in front of the Emperor and bowing]: Sorry, your Majesty. 
[Chien-Po lifts up the Emperor and runs over to Mulan who is by a rope attached to a column inthe balcony. Chien-Po uses his sash as a pulley and rides down the rope to the ground. Shan Yuwatches the Emperor leave]
Shan-Yu: No! 
[Shan-Yu uses his free arm to elbow Shang in the face. Shan-Yu gets up and head-butts Shang andthrows him to the ground. Shang lies limp. Mulan watches Shang fall then she looks over theedge at Ling and Yao now on the ground. Chien-Po runs off the screen out of sight]
Yao [motioning her to follow]: Come on!
[Mulan looks down at Shang with a worried look. Shan-Yu begins to approach Mulan and the rope. Mulan looks at the approaching Shan-Yu and then down to spy his sword. Thinking quickly, Mulan grabsShan-Yu's sword and cuts the taught rope. Shan-Yu reaches the edge and grabs for the falling rope unsuccessfully as Mulan leaves thesword embedded in the column and runs to Shang's position. The crowd cheers]
Shan-Yu: No! [He looks down at the crowd and realizes he cannot find the Emperor among thethrong of people] Yrraaaaahhhh!
[Shan-Yu turns and looks back and sees Mulan looking concerned, holding up Shang. Shan-Yu pullsout his sword lodged in the column and heads toward them. As Shang sees Shan-Yu approaching, heputs his arm in front of Mulan to ask her to leave and takes out his knife. Mulan slides away. Shan-Yu comes up to Shang, knocks away his knife, slaps him in the face, and grabs Shang by theshirt collar]
Shan-Yu [in Shang's face]: You, you took away my victory.
[Mulan's shoe hits Shan-Yu in the head and bounces back to her feet. Shan-Yu turns toward Mulan]
Mulan: No! I did! [Mulan pulls her hair back to look like she did when she was a soldier]
Shan-Yu [looking at Mulan]: The soldier from the mountains.
[Shan-Yu drops Shang and starts after Mulan as she puts on her shoe and runs down the stairs andthrough the doors to the balcony. She closes the door with the latch falling in place rightbehind her. She leans against the doors. Shan-Yu punches a hole in one door with his fist. Mulan runs away from the doors down the corridor. Mushu riding Shan-Yu's falcon like a horsecatches up with Mulan]
Mushu: So what's the plan?
Mulan: Ummmm.
Mushu: You don't have a plan?!
Mulan: Hey, I'm making this up as I...[looks out a window and spies the firework tower] go. Mushu--
Mushu: I'm way ahead of you sister. C'mon Cri-Kee. [Mushu and Cri-Kee jump onto a kite and usethe wings to soar over toward the fireworks tower]
[Cut to Shan-Yu. Shan-Yu breaks through the doors and catches up to Mulan swinging his swordwildly knocking down a support column with every swipe. Mulan runs and ducks his every blow.

PART 13

(Evening, it is dark. Music greets Joe and Ann as they walk down the steps on the way to the barges. He pays the ticketseller as Ann stands, watching the dancing across the river.)

JOE
(to the ticketseller)
Grazzi. 

(He walks over to Ann, smiling to her and they continue.)
(They walk onto the dance floor and start dancing.)
(Two men in black suits and hats--Secret Service men--watch out over the people. One of them turns to watch the dance floor and notices Joe and Ann, watching them as they dance. The Secret Service man stands on his feet and the other looks over at what he is watching. As the music stops for the next song, the man speaks some Italian to the other who leaves, and continues watching as the next dance starts. The other man runs back towards the steps, away from the dancers.)
(Joe and Ann continue dancing--closer now as it is a slower song. She rests her head on his shoulder, her eyes closed and smiling. She looks up at him.)

ANN
Hello. 

JOE
(as they look at each other)
Hello. 
(Joe smiles as she rests her head against his chest and they continue.)
(The band finishes the dance and the audience claps, the dancers on the floor dispersing. Joe and Ann walk over to the side of the floor.)

ANN
(looking up to him as she sits down)
Mr. Bradley: if you don't mind my saying so, I think you are a ringer. 

JOE
(confused)
Oh-- wha--? 

(Understanding, smiling; sitting down)
Oh. Thanks very much. 

ANN
You spent the whole day doing things I've always wanted to. Why? 

JOE
(guiltily)
I don't know. Seemed the thing to do. 

ANN
I never heard of anybody so kind. 

JOE
(he looks down, hiding his guilt)
Wasn't any trouble. 

ANN
Also completely unselfish. 

JOE
(Joe looks over to the other side of the barge, motioning to Ann)
Let's have a drink at the bar. 

(Joe takes her hand and they walk over.)

MARIO DELANI
(turns to Ann, smiling)
Oh! Finalmentez: there you are! 

(Remembering his manners to the woman apparently accompanying him)
Er, scusatmitanto. 

(Turning immediately back to Ann)
I look for you long time--I think maybe you not come 

(he pauses, noticing Joe standing just behind her, watching. He motions to her hair.)
Ah, off; all off! 

ANN
Oh, it's nice without, isn't it? Cool. 

MARIO DELANI
Oh, very, very good. 

ANN
(introducing him)
Mr. Bradley. 

MARIO DELANI
I, Mario Delani. 

JOE
Old friends? 

ANN
Oh, yes; he cut my hair this afternoon. He invited me here, tonight. 

JOE
(to Mario)
Wha- what did you say the name was? 

MARIO DELANI
(shaking Joe's hand)
Delani, Mario Delani. 

JOE
Mario Delani, I'm very glad to know you. 

MARIO DELANI
(the band starts playing again)
Me too. 

(To Ann, using his hands, unsure of his English)
Oh, may I enjoy myself, er, the pleasure? 

(To Joe)
Do you mind? 

JOE
No, no; go right ahead. 

MARIO DELANI
Thank you. 
(Ann takes his hand and they go out on the floor to dance. Joe, watches them dancing for a moment then takes out a notebook, quickly writing something down. Irving arrives at the bottom of the steps, saying something in Italian and holding up his camera as he walks past. He walks towards the barges. The Secret Service man watches Ann as she dances with Mario.)

IRVING
(to Joe, at the bar)
Ciao, Joe. Did I miss anything? 

JOE
(quietly)
You're just in time, pal. 

IRVING
Who's Smithy dancing with? 

JOE
Barber--cut her hair this afternoon, made a date for tonight. 

IRVING
(musing as he watches them)
'The Princess and the Barber'. 

(Mario and Ann continue dancing, having a great time.)
(Irving walks around the other side of the bar, his camera placed on the table, Joe hiding it from the view of the floor. The barman protests but Irving reassures him, keeping his eyes on Ann. Irving watches, waiting, and then, with a signal, Joe jumps away and the bulb flashes as Irving takes the picture. In an instant Joe jumps back, nonchalantly looking up at the sky while Irving takes his glass, doing the same.)
(Ann looks out across the floor and then, seeing Joe and Irving, waves. Irving lifts his glass in acknowledgement.)
(On the bridge, up above the dancing, several cars pull up. Several men climb out, rushing over to the steps. The first Secret Service man, smoking a cigarette, watches the men approach. The men walk over to the tables.)
(Ann continues dancing with Mario who suddenly stops, looking at her hair.)

ANN
What is it? 

MARIO DELANI
Moment. 

(He stops, thinking, and then, taking out a comb, brushes her fringe apart which he delicately curls around with his comb into two neat tufts. He puts his comb away, satisfied. Ann moves to touch her hair but Mario quickly motions her to leave it alone and they continue dancing.)
(One of the Secret Service men stands leaning against a structure, swinging his hand to the beat, smiling. The man watching behind rebukes him with a word and his expression turns serious as he pulls his hat down, putting his hands in his pockets, looking out again over the dancing.)
(The music stops and everyone applauds the musicians.)

MARIO DELANI
Thank you. 

(The first Secret Service man comes over to Ann then Mario, seeing him, says something to Ann in Italian, then "Bye", and leaves her to him.)
(Ann smiles slightly but nervously to the man and they start to dance. They turn several times, then the man speaks in her ear.)

SECRET SERVICE MAN
Your Highness. 

(She looks at up him sharply, and tries to pull away but he holds her)
You'll dance quietly towards the entrance. There is a car waiting. 

ANN
(desperately; trying to pull away)
No. 

SECRET SERVICE MAN
Your Highness, please. 

ANN
(as he forces her over to the side)
You- you've made a mistake. 

(Tells him in Italian, pretending, that she doesn't speak English)
Let me go. 

(Loudly)
Will you let me go! 

(Shouting)
Mr. Bradley! 

(Joe looks up and starts toward her, looking for her in the dancers)
Let me go, will you? Mr. Bradley! 
(Irving looks around from his drink and, seeing the problem, rushes after Joe. Two of the Secret Service men drag Ann away from the barges but Joe catches them and pushes them away, pushing one of them down, and taking Ann by the arm. Joe punches one man who tries to pull Ann the other way but the other one manages to push Irving over the railing of the gangway and almost into the water. Joe and Ann run to the other side of the floor, where the dancers have dispersed and are watching the action.)
(Joe sees more Secret Service coming from the other side so he runs back the other way. Cornered, he confronts them head-on as they close, Ann standing to the side as he throws one over the side. Ann has the presence of mind to throw him a life belt to him and the crowd cheers. Irving meanwhile struggles with one of the men, having his beard pulled, but responds to this with an angry punch to the face. Mario runs over his hair with his comb, muttering some Italian to the people near him before rushing in to the fray to help Joe. The conductor of the band motions to the musicians to start playing and they respond with an energetic tune. The scene of chaos continues, Joe and Irving and Mario laying into the Secret Service men. Distracted, two of the men manage to grab Ann and drag her away. Joe runs after, Irving following with his camera.)
(Joe pushes one of the men to the ground and the other responds with a punch, freeing Ann. Ann looks around her for a way to help, picking up a bottles and throws it weakly at Joe's man. Joe keeps fighting with the man as Ann picks up a guitar lying near the band and stands behind him, on a chair. One of the men starts towards her and there is drum roll as she lifts the guitar over her head, then swings it down, hitting him full on the head, stunning him for a moment.)

IRVING
(excitedly, trying to get his camera ready, having missed the shot the first time)
Hit him again, Smithy! 
(The drummer rolls again as Ann swings the guitar back, then releasing it and smashing it over the man's head--the camera flashing as she does so.)
(Police sirens sound and the Polizia arrive, packed into their cars. As they spill out, Joe, Ann, and Irving start to leave the scene, leaving the Secret Service men staggering or lying about the dance floor, dazed.)

IRVING
Joe, give me my car keys. 

JOE
(to Irving; he stops, pointing at the police)
Police, police. 

IRVING
(seeing them arrive in numbers they change their direction)
The other side of the bridge. 
(As Joe and Ann run across the barges, Irving tries stalling the men who try to follow with a life belt but they make it past him, running to follow Ann. Joe and Ann run through a boathouse and on reaching the other end walk along the outside edge, just above the water.)
(Unseen, a Secret Service man covers the outside of the boathouse as they double back. Joe peers round the corner and the man surprises him with a punch to the face, knocking him into the water. Ann knees him in the groin and pushes him away. She holds her nose and dives in after Joe, just escaping the reach of the man as he tries to stop her. The Polizia arrest the remaining Secret Service men and take them away, one of them being dragged by a guitar around his neck, his head clean through the guitar. The band starts up again and people replace the fallen furniture as the crowd waves across the water, apparently after Joe and Ann as they swim away.)
(Joe and Ann stagger out of the water, completely wet through. Joe leads her to a rock where they sit down, Joe rubbing her around the shoulders as she shivers.)

JOE
Alright? 

ANN
Fine. How are you? 

JOE
Oh, fine! 

(They laugh out loud for several moments. He looks at her)
Say, you know, you were great back there. 

ANN
You weren't so bad yourself--
(she stops suddenly, looking into his eyes. He leans forward and kisses her--a long, steady kiss. They look at each other for a moment.)

JOE
(after a pause)
Well.... I... I guess we'd better get Irving's car, and get out of here. 
(They stand up and hurry on their way.)

PART 7


HENNESSY
Ah, now I'd like to make a little side-bet with you: five hundred says you don't come up with the story. 

(Joe takes out the paper, unfolding it and taking a good look at the front page again)
What are you lookin' at that for? 

JOE
Oh, I just wanna see what time it is. 

HENNESSY
Huh? 

JOE
Er, what day it is, er--
(puts the paper away)
It's a deal! 

HENNESSY
Now I'd 

(offering his hand)
(you)
to shake. 

(Joe pauses then shakes. Hennessy laughs and Joe smiles with him)
Now, let's see, you're into me for about five hundred; when you lose this bet you'll owe me a thousand. 

(Laughing)
Why, you poor sucker, I'll practically own you! 

JOE
You have practically owned me for a couple of years now, but that's all over. 

(As Hennessy continues laughing, leaning on the desk)
I'm gonna win that money and with it I'm gonna buy me a 
(one way ticket)
back to 
(New York!)

HENNESSY
Go on, go on--I'll love to hear you whine! 

JOE
And when I'm in a real newsroom I'll enjoy thinking about you, sitting here with an empty leash in your hands and nobody to twitch for you! 

HENNESSY
(stopping Joe, who stops in the doorway to face him)
So long, 

(raises his right hand, his finger and thumb in an 'O')
Peachy. 

(Joe leaves.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Outside Joe's apartment. Giovanni paces outside the door, a gun strapped to him, copying the actions of a sentry. A crowd of children sitting on the stairwell make fun of him. He goes after them, telling them off and they back away, shouting and laughing. As the children sit back down on the stairs Joe enters the open door leading outside and walks up the stairs, carefully avoiding the children, playfully batting one of them on the head with his newspaper.)

GIOVANNI
(as Joe arrives at the top)
What's your problem? 

JOE
Everything ok, Giovanni? 

GIOVANNI
(reassuring him, proudly)
Listen here, Joe: er, nobody is come, nobody is go; absolutely nobody. 

JOE
Swell! thanks a lot. 

(He is about to go into his apartment but stops, turning to Giovanni)
Oh er, Giovanni, er... 

(Putting his arm round him, leading him to the side)
How would you like to make some money? 

GIOVANNI
Money? 

JOE
Yeah. 

(Giovanni responds in agreement in Italian.)
That's the stuff. Now look, I've got a sure thing: double your money back in two days. 

GIOVANNI
(suspiciously)
Double my money? 

JOE
Yeah well, I need a little investment capital to swing the deal. Now, if you'll just lend me a little cash, I--. 

GIOVANNI
(says some Italian.)
You owing me tomorrow's rent (JOE I know, I know, I know.) and you want me to lend you money? (JOE Yeah.) 

(Emphatically)
No, 

(Some Italian)
no! 

JOE
(pointing his paper at him)
Tomorrow, you'll be sorry! 

(Joe goes through his front door, seeing Princess Ann still asleep in his bed. He shuts the door quietly, fastening the chain across, also. Joe stands looking at her for a moment then moves round to the other side of the bed--the side she is facing lying down. He stands above her, looking at her face then looking again at the newspaper picture to compare them. He sits down beside her and moves a lock of her out of the way to get a better view of her face. He holds the picture up beside her but her hand still partially covers her face. He tickles her hand and she moves it restlessly. He leans closer to her:)

JOE
(quietly)
Your Highness? 

(She stirs with a "Mmmm-mmmmm".)
Your 
(Royal)
Highness? 

ANN
(turning to her other side, sighing)
Yes... what is it? 
(Joe sits up in delight, the fact of her identity passing through his mind. He stands up, excitedly putting the newspaper back in his pocket, and walks around the bed. Seeing the alarm clock on the cupboard missing he picks it up from the bed and replaces it. He replaces the pillow in its proper place, smoothing out the sheets then walks back around to Princess Ann. He carefully picks up her left arm, putting it around his neck, then slides his arms under her head and legs and carries her--blankets included--around to the other side of the bed. He is about to put her down but sees that she is holding her the wrong way. All of a sudden he hears police sirens sound outside and stops for a moment, then, still holding her, picks up the pillow with one hand and puts it at the other end of the bed, laying her down gently. She continues sleeping as he goes over to the window and looks down at the street at some police cars coming into view around a corner. Looking back anxiously at the Princess he goes back in.)

ANN
(stirring slightly)
Dear Doctor Bonnachoven. 

JOE
(not sure what to do)
Hmm? 

(Playing along, not wanting to disturb her)
Oh, oh, sure, yes. Well, er...er, you're fine; much better. Is there anything you want? 

ANN
Hmm? So many things. 

JOE
Yes? well tell the doctor (ANN So many--). Tell the good doctor everything. 

ANN
(without opening her eyes, stirring in the bed, spreading her arm)
Mmmmm, I dreamt and I dreamt... 

JOE
Yes? Well, er, what did you dream? 

(Holding her wrist as a doctor might.)

ANN
I dreamt I was asleep on the street and... young man came and he was tall and strong and--
(screwing her face up)
he was so mean to me. 

JOE
He was? 

(He lets her arm down.)

ANN
Mmmm. 

(Blissfully; putting her arm over her eyes)
It was wonderful. 
(She opens her arms, stretching a little. Lying face-up, not quite awake yet, she looks at the ceiling, seeing the plumbing visible in the corner--quite different to the ornamentation of the Embassy bedchamber. Then she looks at Joe standing over her. She closes her eyes, smiling, then opens them again, her expression becoming severe as she stares at him.)

JOE
(cheerfully)
Good morning. 

ANN
(she starts; in a low, worried tone)
Where's Doctor Bonnachoven? 

JOE
(unbothered)
Er, I'm afraid I don't know anybody by that name. 

ANN
(puzzled)
Wasn't I talking to him just now? 

JOE
'Fraid not. 

ANN
(suddenly frightened; feeling herself beneath the sheets)
Have- have I had an accident? 

JOE
No. 

ANN
(reassured)
Quite safe for me to sit up, huh? 

JOE
Yeah, 

(bending down to her)
perfect 

(he lifts her pillow back and helps her sit up, leaning against it. She looks at him all the while, not fully trusting of him.)
(Joe leans against the cupboard at the foot of the bed.)

ANN
Thank you 

(he smiles back. She looks down at her pyjamas then to Joe)
Are these yours? 
(He nods. Ann, suddenly panicked, feels under the sheets for her pyjama bottoms.)

JOE
Er, did- did you lose something? 

ANN
(smiling, relieved)
No. No. 

(Politely, suppressing her anxiety)
W-would you be so kind as tell me w-where I am? 

JOE
Well, this is what is laughingly known as my apartment. 

ANN
(concerned; rising suddenly)
Did you bring me here by force? 

JOE
No, no, no... 

(smiling)
quite the contrary. 

ANN
Have I been here all night...alone? 

JOE
(smiling)
If you don't count me, yes. 

ANN
(seriously)
So I've spent the night here--with you. 

JOE
(hurrying to reassure her)
Oh, well, now, I- I don't know if I'd use those words exactly, but er, from a certain angle, yes. 
(Ann looks down, thinking. After a moment, reassured that everything is alright afterall, laughs.)

PART 9

GIOVANNI
Ah, double my money, eh? You tell me you want double my money (JOE 
(waving his hand up at him, reassuring him)
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.) that way? 

(Repeating to himself, after Joe has walked past)
Eh, tomorrow. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Ann walks out onto the busy city street, dodging a motorbike as she arrives from a side-street. She looks out fascinated at all the activity, momentarily intimidated, but then venturing out confidently as she enjoys the bustle of the city around her.)
(Joe peers down the street after her, running between the people in order to keep within sight. He follows her into a market as Ann wanders along, taking her time, just enjoying herself. She walks past several vendors offering her their goods.)
(As Ann stops to look at a stall Joe has to back off, and is instantly targetted by the nearest vendor who offers him some of his huge melons. He shakes his head at him, more interested in keeping an eye on Ann who tries on a pair of shoes at the stall, then pays the woman vendor for them. Joe's vendor persists and Joe finally buys the melon off him, which at once quietens him down. So, carrying the melon, he follows Ann down to another street where she stops, looking out at the Fontana di Trevi: a magnificent facade ornamented with statues, fronted by a pool.)
(Ann continues down the street that runs beside the fountain, stopping outside a salon to look at the drawings of hairstyles in the window which surround a mirror. She appears disappointed at the way she looks in the mirror and, after smiling at the hair of someone who walks past, decides to go inside.)
(Joe walks up the the shop, smiling when he sees where she has gone.)

(Inside the hair salon Ann sits on one of the seats in front of the large mirror, holding up her long hair as the hairdresser (Mario Delani) fastens the cover around her.)

MARIO DELANI
(speaking rather hesitant English)
What a wonderful er, hair you have. 

(He asks her something in Italian.)

ANN
Just cut, thank you. 

MARIO DELANI
Just cut? 

(Takes the scissors from his hair)
Well then, cut, er, so? 

(he holds the hair at a certain length.)

ANN
Higher. 

MARIO DELANI
Higher? 

(He holds the hair further up)
Here? 

ANN
More. 

MARIO DELANI
Here? 

ANN
Even more. 

MARIO DELANI
(impatiently)
Where? 

ANN
(she holds her hair at the shoulders)
There. 

MARIO DELANI
There. 

(Snapping his scissors nervously)
Are you sure, Miss? 

ANN
(emphatically)
I'm quite sure, thank you. 

MARIO DELANI
(he turns he round in the chair, taking her hair in his hand)
All off? 

ANN
All off. 
(Joe peers in them through the beaded curtain, still holding his melon.)
MARIO DELANI
(uncomfortable as he starts cutting off her long hair)
Off. 
(Joe goes outside, looking round, then walks away down the street.)
(Ann sits in the salon still, her hair covering her face.)

MARIO DELANI
(pulling apart her hair to see her)
Are you sure? 

ANN
(impatiently)
Yes. 

MARIO DELANI
(dropping her hair back over her face)
Yes. 

(As he cuts her locks off, working his way round)
Off! off; off.. 

(wipes his forehead with his arm.)
(Joe finds a public phone down the street opposite the fountain. Joe waits impatiently, studying his melon, as another person speaks on the phone, in Italian. Then, seeing a group of children playing on the statue, goes over to one of them, passing his melon to a boy.)
(Back in the salon, the hairdresser cuts of the last lock of her hair.)

MARIO DELANI
Off! 

(He stands to the side of her as they both study the end result as Ann moves her head slightly from side to side. She looks down at something but, engrossed in her, the hairdresser jerks her head back to the centre to get a better view.)
(Outside, Joe sees a group of American schoolgirls, playing and talking around the fountain. He approaches one who carries a camera.)

JOE
(gently coaxing her to get a look at the camera)
That's a nice little camera you have there. Ah, it's nice. Mmmm. Er, you don't mind if I just borrow it, do you? 

(He tries to coax it off her but the strap is around her neck.)

SCHOOLGIRL 1
(calling out; putting her hand up)
Miss Weber! 

JOE
I'll give it back... just for a couple of minutes. 

SCHOOLGIRL 2
(trying to resist him)
No. Go, it's my camera. 
(Their teacher comes over, looking over Joe darkly. He lets go of the camera as the teacher leads the student away, then holds his head in his hand, embarrassed.)
(In the salon someone sweeps the hair up off the floor. Mario Delani is combing her hair, touching up the ends.)

MARIO DELANI
You musician, maybe? You artist, aha? Painter...? I know: you model! 

(She smiles, flattered)
Model, hah? 

ANN
Thank you. 

MARIO DELANI
(says some Italian)
Finito. It's perfect. 

ANN
Oh. 

MARIO DELANI
(as the hairdresser turns her round from side to side, looking in the mirror)
Y-y-you be nice without long hair. Now, it's cool, hmm? Cool? 

ANN
(turning her head to the side, playing with the ends)
Yes, it's, it's just what I wanted. 

MARIO DELANI
Grazzi. 

(As she looks in the mirror)
Now, why you not come dancing tonight with me? You should see, it's so nice: it's on a boat on the Tib¨¦rine, Tiber--the river by Saint Angelo--
(dramatically)
moonlight, music, romantico! It's very, very.. 

(his English vocab runs out)
very. Please, you come? 

ANN
I wish I could. 

MARIO DELANI
(disappointed)
Oh. 

(As Ann gets up, taking out her money)
But, but, your friend: I think they not recognise you. 

ANN
No, I don't think they will! 

(She gives him the money.)

MARIO DELANI
Oh, thank you very much. 

ANN
Thank you. 

MARIO DELANI
(as she leaves he rushes out the door after her)
Ah, er, senorina. 

(Standing in the doorway as she turns to him)
After nine o'clock, I'll be there. Dancing on river--remember: Saint Angelo. If you come, you will me most pretty of all girl! 

ANN
(she smiles, surprised and flattered)
Thank you. Goodbye. 

MARIO DELANI
(as she leaves)
Goodbye. 
(Joe, watching from across the square, sees her leave and follows her. She passes by a shop window, stopping to look, and seeing her reflection checks her new hair. Joe follows her down the street towards the Spanish Steps. He keeps a safe distance as she waits for a gap in the traffic, dashing across. She walks up to an icecream vendor nearby, presenting him with some money.)

ANN
Er, 

(unsure of the word)
Gelato? 

ICECREAM SELLER
(nodding)
Gelato. 

(He bends down to scoop up her icecream, all of this watched by Joe from the opposite side of the street.)

ANN
(taking her icecream)
Thank you. 

(She pays him the money.)

ICECREAM SELLER
(calling after her)
Senorina. 

(Hands her her change, speaking some Italian.)

ANN
Oh! grazzi. 
(She walks away, licking her icecream. A flower seller catches her attention as she walks past.)

FLOWER MAN
(speaks some Italilan, presenting her with some flowers)
It is 

(some Italian)
beautiful lady. 

(Speaks in Italian, eagerly trying to make the sell, handing her the flowers. She shakes his hand in thanks but he waves his hand, speaking more Italian.)
..five thousand lira!

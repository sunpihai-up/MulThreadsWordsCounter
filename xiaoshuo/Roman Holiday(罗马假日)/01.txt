NEWSREEL
Paramount News brings you a special coverage of Princess Ann's visit to London, the first stop on her much publicised goodwill tour of European capitals. She gets a royal welcome from the British as thousands cheer the gracious young member of one of Europe's oldest ruling families. After three days of continuous activity and a visit to Buckingham Palace, Ann flew to Amsterdam where Her Royal Highness dedicated the new International Aid Building and christened an ocean liner. Then went to Paris where she attended many official functions designed to cement trade relations between her country and the Western European nations. And so to Rome, the eternal city, where the Princess' visit was marked by a spectacular military parade highlighted by the band of the crack Piersa Yeri Regiment. The smiling young Princess showed no sign of the strain of the week's continuous public appearances. And at her country's embassy that evening, a formal reception and ball in her honor was given by her country's ambassador to Italy. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(The Embassy ballroom. People fill the floor of the room. A fanfare sounds. The Master of Ceremonies appears and the people clear a path down the middle of the hall in front of him. The Master of Ceremonies announces "Her Royal Highness"--first in Italian, then in English.)
(The orchestra starts playing as the Master of Ceremonies walks down the newly-formed aisle. Princess Ann, resplendent in her ballgown, diamond tiara, and necklace, appears at the door accompanied by the Ambassador in formal military dress. Behind them follow together the Countess Vereberg and General Provno, and others. As the company walks slowly down the aisle, Princess Ann smiles and nods her head to acknowledge the guests who line their path. They bow as the Princess walks past them.)
(As they reach the front, the Princess and the others step onto the dais as the orchestra finishes playing. The dais is furnished with chairs--a large one in the center. The Princess and the others stand, facing the guests. Princess Ann is about to sit when the Ambassador discreetly stops her with a hand on her arm.)
(As they stand waiting, the guests form in a line in front. The Master of Ceremonies announces them as they walk forward to greet her, in turn.)

MASTER OF CEREMONIES
His Excellency, the Papal Nuntius, Monsignor Altomonto. 
(Ann greets him warmly in Italian, shaking his hand; he replies, in Italian.)

MASTER OF CEREMONIES
Sir Hugo Macy de Farmington. 

ANN
(he bows to her)
Good evening, Sir Hugo. 

SIR HUGO
(shaking her hand)
Good evening, Your Royal Highness. 

MASTER OF CEREMONIES
His Highness, The Maharajah of Kalipur; and The Rajkumari. 

ANN
(shaking the Rajkumari's hand)
I'm so glad that you could come. 

THE RAJKUMARI
Thank you. 

THE MAHARAJA
(shaking Ann's hand)
Thank you, madame. 

(The Master of Ceremonies announes the next couple, in German.)

ANN
(hidden beneath her dress, she takes her right foot out of its shoe and stretches it)
Guten Abend. 

MASTER OF CEREMONIES
(as Ann puts her foot back)
Prince Istvan Barossy Nagyavaros. 

ANN
How do you do? 

(he kisses her hand)
(The Master of Ceremonies announces the long German name and title of the next guest.)

ANN
(holding the woman's hand as she curtsies)
Guten Abend. 

(She greets the man as he kisses her hand.)
(The Master of Ceremonies announces the next couple. As she greets them, Ann rubs her tired right foot against her leg.)
(Much later on and Ann is still greeting the guests.)

ANN
(greeting another couple)
So happy. 

MASTER OF CEREMONIES
The Count and Countess von Marstrand. 

ANN
Good evening, Countess 

(holding her hand the woman curtsies. To the Count.)
Good evening. 

COUNT
(kissing her hand)
Good evening. 

(Suddenly, Princess Ann loses her balance as her foot slips over her shoe, knocking it over. The Count's eyeglass pops out in surprise and he smiles back as she regathers herself. The Ambassador looks down in disappointment at her error. The Master of Ceremonies introduces the next couple--a Senor and Senora.)

ANN
(she tries to manipulate her shoe back into position which has been knocked over and she greets the couple, disguising her discomfort)
Good evening 

(the man kisses her hand.)
(The Master of Ceremonies announces the next guest as Ann pushes her shoe again in an effort to right it.)

ANN
(as the man bends, gesturing with his hand in greeting)
How do you do? 
(As the last guest moves back Ann looks around anxiously, trying again to right her shoe, resulting in her pushing it further away. The Ambassador then motions her to sit down. As she sits back into the chair with the Ambassador and the Countess on either side her dress pulls back, revealing the shoe.)
(The orchestra starts playing a waltz. Ann tries as inconspicuously as possible to drag her shoe back with her foot. The General, standing behind her frowning, motions to the Countess to look at the shoe. She looks down at it and closes her eyes in horror. The Princess stirs in her seat trying to get her shoe back, fiddling with her gloves as cover. A man standing behind the Ambassador motions to him and he shrugs and gets up, bowing and presenting his arm to the Princess. The Princess rises and, pausing for time to regather her shoe, is lead onto the ballroom floor by the Ambassador. Taking her up to dance he looks at the area in front of the eat and, relieved that the shoe isn't to be seen, continues dancing with her as the other guests watch. )
(Later on and the dance floor is filled people. Princess Ann dances with a short, lively gentleman who rattles off rapid Spanish phrases to her. She listens, nodding and smiling politely. Still later and she dances with a short, elderly gentlemen. They smile and nod to each other silently. Later again and Ann dances with a somewhat remote gentlemen. She almost speaks so as to strike up a conversation, but thinks better of it.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Later that night in Princess Ann's bedchamber. She stands on her bed dressed in her nightgown, her hair let down. She picks up the skirt of her nightgown and drops it.)

ANN
(brushing her hair)
I hate this nightgown. I hate all my nightgowns. And I hate all my underwear too. 

COUNTESS
(coming over to tend to her bed, dressed in a bedrobe and wearing glasses)
My dear, you have lovely things. 

ANN
But I'm not two hundred years old! 

(Dropping down on the bed)
Why can't I sleep in pyjamas? 

COUNTESS
(looking up as she folds the sheets into place)
Pyjamas! 

ANN
(Just)
the top half. 

(The Countess takes off her glasses, shocked, then walks over to the window. Ann pulls the covers over her, sitting up)
Did you know there are people who sleep with absolutely 
(nothing)
on at all? 

COUNTESS
(opening the window)
I rejoice to say that I did not. 

ANN
(lying against the headboard, smiling as she hears distant music coming in through the window)
Listen. 

(She jumps up out of bed and runs over to the window, looking out.)

COUNTESS
Oh, and your slippers. 

(She goes to fetch them from beside the bed as Ann looks out with pleasure at the dancing going on far below in the distance)
Please put on your slippers and come away at the window. 

(Ann walks back to the bed, dejected, as the Countess shuts the window. The Countess holds a tray)
Your milk and crackers. 

ANN
(taking the tray; as the Countess helps her pull the covers over her)
Everything we do is so wholesome. 

COUNTESS
They'll help you to sleep. 

ANN
(stubbornly)
I'm too tired to sleep--can't sleep a wink. 

COUNTESS
(putting on her glasses, taking a diary from the bedtable)
Now my dear, if you don't mind: tomorrow's schedule--or schedule 

((skedule),)
whichever you prefer--both are correct. 

(Running through the items with a pen)
Eight thirty, breakfast here with the Embassy staff; nine o'clock, we leave for the Polinory Automotive Works where you'll be presented with a small car. 

ANN
(disinterested; absently playing with a napkin)
Thank you. 

COUNTESS
Which you will not accept. 

ANN
No, thank you. 

COUNTESS
Ten thirty-five, inspection of food and agricultural organisation will present you with an olive tree.

ANN
Thank you. 

COUNTESS

ANN

COUNTESS
Yes. 

ANN
(chewing a cracker)
For the orphans? 

COUNTESS
No, no, the other one. 

ANN
'Youth and progress'. 

COUNTESS
Precisely. Eleven forty-five, back here to rest. No, that's wrong... eleven forty-five, conference here with the press. 

ANN
'Sweetness and decency' 

(she rolls her eyes.)

COUNTESS
One o'clock sharp, lunch with the Foreign Ministry. You will wear your white lace and carry a small bouquet of (& ANN) very small pink roses. 

(The Countess looks up, unimpressed. Continuing, as Ann drinks her milk from a glass)
Three-o five, presentation of a plaque. 
(ANN (to an imagined guest:) Thank you.)

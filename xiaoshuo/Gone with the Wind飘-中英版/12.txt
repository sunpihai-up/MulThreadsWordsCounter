（媚兰重病。她知时日已不多，要见思嘉。）
思嘉：是我，媚兰。
媚兰：答应我……希礼…希礼和你。
思嘉：希礼怎么样，媚兰？
媚兰：替我照顾他，就象你那时替他照顾我一样。
思嘉：我会的，媚兰。
媚兰：照顾他，可别让他知道。
思嘉：晚安。
媚兰：答应我？
思嘉：还有什么，媚兰？
媚兰：巴特勒上尉……对他好一些……他这么爱你。
思嘉：好的，媚兰。
（媚兰过世。思嘉安慰心碎的希礼，忽视了瑞德的存在。瑞德无法忍受而离开。但突然间思嘉发现了事实，她不爱希礼。她转而寻找瑞德。）
思嘉：瑞德，等等我！瑞德，等等我，瑞德！瑞德！
（起居室外）
瑞德：进来。
思嘉：瑞德。 瑞德：媚兰，她已经・・二…主眷顾她了。她是我见过的唯-一个毫无理庇的好人。伟大的女人。一个不平凡的女人。虽然她死了，这对你来说是好事，是吗？
思嘉：你怎么能这么说。你知道我是真的爱她的。
瑞德：我真不知道，但至少到最后你都欣赏她了。
思嘉：我当然欣赏她。她从来为别人着想，不为自己，她最后的话也是为你。
瑞德：她怎么说？
思嘉：她说，对巴特勒上尉好一点。他这样爱你。
瑞德：她说别的了吗？
思：她说，她还说要我照顾希礼。
瑞德：有了前妻的允许，一切都方便多了，是吗？
思嘉：你什么意思？你在干什么？
瑞德：我要离开你了，亲爱的。你现在需要的是离婚，你关于希礼的梦要实现了。
思嘉：不，不，你错了！全错了！我不要离婚，噢，瑞德，今晚上我才知道，才知道我原来是爱你的，我就跑回家来告诉你。懊，亲爱的，亲爱的！
瑞德：请别这样，给我们的婚姻留一点可以回忆的尊严吧，最后的时候烧了彼此吧。 思嘉：最后？噢，瑞德，你听我说，我这么久以来一定是一直爱着你，但我这么傻，一直不知道，请相信我。你一定是在乎我的，媚兰说你在乎的。
瑞德：我相信你，那么希礼・威尔克斯呢？
思嘉：我，我从没有真的爱过他。
瑞德：至少到今天早上你一直装得很象那么回事。噢，思嘉，我已经想尽各种办法了。哪怕是我从伦敦回来时，你对我好点--
思嘉：我是很高兴见到你回来的。但是，瑞德，你当时那么讨厌。
瑞德：而且在体病的时候，那全是我的错，我一直希望你会叫我，但你没有。
思嘉：我想要你，我非常想，但是我想也许你不要我。
瑞德：看来，我们俩很不协调，是吗？现在没用了。有邦尼 的时候，我们还可能快乐。我喜欢把邦尼当成你。还是小姑娘，是没有受战争、贫穷摧残的你。她很象你，我可以宠她， 放纵她，就象我想宠爱你一样。但她一死，她把什么都带走 了。
思嘉：噢，瑞德，瑞德，别再说了。我很难过，为发生的一切 难过。
瑞德：我亲爱的，你真是个孩子。你以为说句对不起，过去的一切就都改正过来了。把我的手帕拿去，你在任何危急的关头我都没见你有过一条手帕。
思嘉：瑞德，瑞德，你去哪儿？
瑞德：我要去查尔斯顿，去应该属于我的地方。
思嘉：请你带我一起去吧！
瑞德：不，我对这儿的一切都厌倦了。我想要安静，我想看看生命中还有什么有高尚和美丽。你知道我在讲什么吗？
思嘉：不，我只知道我爱你。
瑞德：这是你的不幸。
恩惠：瑞德！你要走，我去哪里呢？我该怎么办呢？
瑞德：坦白说，我亲爱的，我一点也不关心。
思嘉：我不能让他走，不能！一定有办法让他回来。噢，现在我想不了这些，不然我要想疯了。明天，明天再想。我一定要想清楚，一定！现在干什么呢？什么才重要呢？
（父亲和希礼的话在她耳边回响起来。）
奥哈拉：你想告诉我，凯蒂・思嘉・奥哈拉，德园对你毫无意义吗？土地是唯一重要的东西，是唯一永恒的东西。
希礼：有些东西你爱它胜过爱我，只是你不知道。
奥哈拉：德园，你从这儿吸取力量。 希礼：德园，德园的红土。
奥哈拉：土地是唯一重要的东西，唯一永恒的东西。
希礼：只是你不知道，有些东西你爱它胜过爱我，德园。
奥哈拉：你从这儿吸取力量……
希礼：德园的红土……
奥哈拉：土地是唯一重要的东西。
希礼：有些东西你爱它胜过爱我……
奥与希礼：德园的红土……德园！德园！
思嘉：德园！我要回家，我要想办法让他回来。不管怎样，明天是新的一天！ （完）
   
Chapter 12 Tara, Land of Hope

(Melanie is seriously sick. She knows there is not much
time left for her, and begs to see Scarlett.)
SCARLETT: It's me, Mellie.
MELANIE: Promise me. Ashley...Ashley and you...
SCARLETT: What about...Ashley, Mellie?
MELANIE: Look after him for me. Just as you looked
after me for him.
SCARLETT: I will, Mellie.
MELANIE: Look after him. But never let him know.
SCARLETT: Good night.
MELANIE: Promise?
SCARLETT: What else, Mellie?
MELANIE: Captain Butler...be kind to him...he loves you
so...
SCARLETT: Yes, Mellie.
(Melanie passes away. Scarlett comforts the heart-broken
Ashley, neglecting the existence of Rhett Butler, who
couldn't bear to see the scene, leaves. But suddenly
Scarlett sees the fact, she doesn't love Ashley anymore.
So she goes to look for Rhett everywhere.)
SCARLETT: Rhett, wait for me! Rhett, wait for me! Rhett!
Rhett!
(Outside the restroom.)
RHETT: Come in.
SCARLETT: Rhett!
RHETT: Melanie, she's...well. God rest her. She was the
only completely kind person I ever knew. Great lady. A
very great lady. Though she's dead. That makes it nice
for you, doesn't it?
SCARLETT: Oh, how can you say such things. You know
how I loved her really.
RHETT: No, I don't know that I do. But at least it's to
your credit that you could appreciate her at the end.
SCARLETT: Of course I appreciated her. She thought of
everybody except herself. Why her last words were about
you.
RHETT: What did she say?
SCARLETT: She said, be kind to Captian Butler, he loves
you so.
RHETT: Did she say anything else?
MELANIE: She said, she asked me to look after Ashley
too.
RHETT It's convenient to have the first wife's permission,
isn't it?
SCARLETT: What do you mean? What are you doing?
RHETT: I'm leaving you, my dear. All you need now is a
divorce and your dreams of Ashley can come true.
SCARLETT: No! No, you're wrong! Terribly wrong! I don't
want a divorce. Oh Rhett, when I knew tonight, when I
knew I loved you, I ran home to tell you, oh darling,
darling!
RHETT: Please don't go on with this. Leave us some
dignity to remember out of our marriage. Spare us this
last.
SCARLETT: This last? Oh Rhett, do listen to me. I must have loved 
you for years only I was such a stupid fool I didn't know it. Please 
believe me.You must care! Mellie said you did!
RHETT: I believe you. But what about Ashley Wilkes? 
SCARLETT: I......I never really loved Ashley.
RHETT: You certainly gave a good imitation of it up to
this morning. Oh, Scarlett, I tried everything. If you'd
only met me halfway, even when I came back from
London...
SCARLETT: I was so glad to see you, I was Rhett, but,
but you were so nasty!
RHETT: And then when you were sick. And it was all my
fault. I hoped and against hope that you'd call for me.
But you didn't.
SCARLETT: I wanted you. I wanted you desperately, but
I didn't think you wanted me!
RHETT: It seems we've been at crossed purposed, doessn't
it. But it's no use now. As long as there was Bonnie there
was a chance we might be happy. I like to think that
Bonnie was you. A little girl again. Before the war and
poverty had done things to you. She was so like you. And
I could pet her and spoil her as I wanted to spoil you. But
when she went, she took everything.
SCARLETT: Oh, Rhett, Rhett, please don't say that. I'm
so sorry. I'm so sorry for everything.
RHETT: My darling, you're such a child. You think that
by saying I'm sorry, all the past can be corrected. Here,
take my handkerchief. Never in any crisis of your life have
I known you to have a handkerchief.
SCARLETT: Rhett, Rhett where are you going?
RHETT: I'm going to Charleston. Back where I belong.
SCARLETT: Please, please take me with you.
RHETT: No. I'm through with everything here. I want
peace. I want to see if somewhere if there is something
left in life with charm and grace. Do you know what I'm
talking about?
SCARLETT: No. I only know that I love you.
RHETT: That's your misfortune.
SCARLETT: Rhett! If you go, where shall I go? What shall
I do?
RHETT: Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.
SCARLETT: I can't let him go. I can't. There must be
some way to bring him back. Oh, I can't think about that
now. I'll go crazy if I do, I...I'll think about it tomorrow. I
must think about it. I must think about it. What is there
to do? What is there that matters?
( The words other father and Ashley thunder in her ear.)
Mr. O'HARA: You mean to tell me, Katie Scarlett O'Hara,
that Tara doesn't mean anything to you? That land is the
only thing that matters. It's the only thing that lasts.
ASHLEY: Something you love better than me, though you
may not know it.
Mr. O'HARA: Tara, it's this from where you get your
strength.
ASHLEY: Tara, the red earth of Tara.
Mr. O'HARA: That land's the only thing that matters, it's
the only thing that lasts.
ASHLEY: Something you love better than me, though you
may not know it, Tara.
Mr. O'HARA: ...From which you get your strength...
ASHLEY: ... the red earth ofTara.
Mr. O'HARA: Lands the only thing that matters...
ASHLEY: something you love better than me...
Mr. O'HARA plus ASHLEY: ...the red earth of
Tara...Tara!... Tara!... Tara!
SCARLETT: Tara! Home. I'll go home. And I'll think of
some way to get him back. After all, tomorrow is another
day!
(The end)

（奥哈拉先生以前的监工威尔金森同新婚妻子来到德园。他们知道德国现况窘迫，欲购下它。）
思嘉：是你，艾米・史莱迪。
艾米・史莱迪：夫人，是我。
思嘉：站住！
威尔金森（下称威）：你没忘掉我这个老监工吧？现在艾米是威尔金森太太了。
思嘉：快走开，臭婊子I快离开这地方。
威：你不能用那种语气和我妻子说话。
思嘉：为什么？她不早就是你的妻子了。你害死了我母亲，谁去给你另外那些小杂种行洗礼呢？
威：我们是来拜访的，友善地拜访。并想和老朋友谈点小生意。
思嘉：朋友，我们什么时候有你这种朋友了。 威：你还这么高傲自负。你的底细我全知道。你的父亲现在是个白痴。你缴不起税。我们来是跟你买这块地的。准备给你出个好价钱。因为艾米想住在这儿。
思嘉：滚出去，肮脏的北侧
威：你这自视了不起的爱尔兰人。等你为缴税卖这块地时你就知道是谁在这儿说了算。我要买下这儿的一切，住在这儿。不过我会等拍卖时买的。
思：这是你能从德园得到的一切。（思嘉把希礼放在她手心的泥球扔到威尔金森的脸上。）
威：你会为此后悔的。我们还会回来的。（奥哈拉先生骑上马，他怒火中烧，试图截住威尔金森的去路。）
奥哈拉：坐稳了，我来收拾你们！
思嘉：爸爸，回利
奥哈拉：北佬，胆小鬼！
思嘉：爸爸！（奥哈拉先生摔落到地上，再也没起来。几天后…）
思嘉：噢，奶妈，奶妈。
奶妈：你一直都这么勇敢，思嘉。小姐。你要挺住。想想你
爸爸，他一向都很勇敢。 思嘉：我不能想爸爸。除了那三百块钱，我什么都不想。
奶妈：想那些也没用，思嘉小姐。没人有那么多钱。除了北佬和那些投奔他们的南方人以外。
思嘉：瑞德！
奶妈：谁？一个北佬？
思嘉：噢，奶妈，我这么瘦，这么苍白，而且……没什么象样的衣服。上阁楼去，奶妈，去拿妈妈那盒衣服版式来。
奶妈：你拿爱伦小姐的窗帘干吗？
思嘉：你要用它给我做条新裙子。
奶妈：不能用爱伦小姐的窗帘，只要我还有一口气就不行。
思嘉：废话！他们现在是我的了。我要去亚特兰大弄那三百块钱，要看上去象个皇后。
奶妈：谁陪你去亚特兰大？
思嘉：我自己。
奶妈：想得美。我要陪你去，陪着你和那条新裙子。
思嘉：噢，奶妈，亲爱的。
奶妈：对我甜言蜜语也没用，思嘉小姐。我从给你换第一块尿布的时候起就知道你是什么人了。我说过我要跟着你去亚特兰大，我就会去！（亚特兰大监狱。瑞德・巴特勒和监狱长官在围桌打牌。） 士兵：长官，有一位女士来看巴特勒上尉。说她是你的妹妹。
少校：又一个妹妹？这是监狱，不是后宫，巴特勒上尉。
士兵：不，少校。这个跟别的不一样。她有个奶妈陪着来的。
瑞德：是吗？我想会见这一个，少校，不包括那个奶妈。少校：呢…
瑞德：让我看一下我今天下午输了多少？吾…三百四十美元。我债台高筑，是不是，少校？
少校：好吧，下士，带巴特勒上尉和他妹妹去他的监房。
瑞德：谢谢，少校……失陪了，各位。
少校：输了钱还这么高兴，对这种人想虎起脸也不行。（嘉身穿绿色天鹅绒装出现在监狱里。）
思嘉：瑞德！
瑞德：思嘉！我亲爱的妹妹。（对下士）没什么事了，下士。我妹妹把锉和锯带来了。现在我可以真的吻你了吗？
思嘉：在前额上，象个好哥哥。
瑞德：谢谢，那不必了，我还是等更好的吧。
思嘉：唤，瑞德，听说你入了狱，我难过极了。我想得觉都睡不着。他们要绞死你，不是真的吧？ 瑞德：你会难过？
思嘉：噢，瑞德……
瑞德：噢，别担心。那些北佬是大张旗鼓想起诉我，不过他们真想要的是我的钱，他们似乎以为我卷着联合政府的金库跑了。
思嘉：啊，真的？
瑞德：问得多直接。我们别再谈什么铜臭了。你来看我真好。你看上去真漂亮。
思嘉：噢，瑞德。不要再取笑我这种乡下姑娘了。
瑞德：感谢上帝，你没有衣衫褴褛。我可看够那些破衣烂衫的妇女了。转个圈。你好看得能让人吃下去。现在过得不错。思嘉：谢谢，我很好。德园人人都过得很好。只是，我太闷了。我想我应该来城里逛逛。
瑞德：你真是没心没肺，不过这是你魅力的一部分，尽管你的勉力已超出法律允许的范围。
思嘉：瑞德，我现在不是来讲关于自己的这些没用的话。我来是因为你有麻烦，这让我很痛苦。我知道那天晚上在去德园的路上你扔下我，我对你乱发脾气，但我还没有原谅你。瑞德：见思嘉，不要这么说。 思嘉：当然，我得承认要不是你，我早就死了。每当我想到我自己现在是要什么有什么，在这世界上没什么可忧虑，而你却给关在这么可怕的监狱里。甚至关在不是人住的监狱，瑞德，而是马厩。听我说，给我讲几个笑话吧，我真想哭，我真的要哭了。瑞德：思嘉，你难道真的…・・
思嘉：真的什么呀，瑞德？
瑞德：你有了一颗女人的心？一颗真正的女人的心。
思嘉：我有，瑞德，我知道我有。
瑞德：能听到你说这些，真是蹲监狱也值得，非常值得。（瑞德握住思嘉的手，突然他发现她的手掌粗糙，这是一双含辛操劳的手。）你的谎言能让天花乱坠，思嘉。看来德国的一切还真不错，是不是？
思嘉：是的……
瑞德：那你的手怎么会弄成这样？
思嘉：只不过，不过是上星期我骑马没带手套…・
瑞德：这可不是一位贵太太的手。你一定是下田去干农活了。你为什么撒谎？你到底来干什么？
思嘉：噢，瑞德……
瑞德：刚才我几乎相信你是牵挂什么。 思嘉：我是牵挂
瑞德：让我们实话实说吧！你想从我这儿得到什么。那东西对你非常重要，所以你穿上天鹅绒来做成。是什么，钱吗？
思嘉：我想要＊＊0块钱去交德园的税。噢，瑞德，我说的一切都好是真的在骗你。事实上一切都坏得不能再坏了。而你有上百万的家产，瑞德。
瑞德：那你用什么做抵押？
思嘉：我的耳环…
瑞德：不感兴趣。
思嘉：用德园做抵押。
瑞德：我要一个种植园干什么？
思嘉：你不会亏本的。明年棉花丰收了，我就会还你。
瑞德：也不够好。你还有什么更好的吗？
思嘉：你说过你爱我。你如果现在还爱我，瑞德……
瑞德：你别忘了我不是一个要结婚的男人。
思嘉：我没忘。
瑞德：你并不值三百美元。对任何男人，你只意味着痛苦。
思嘉：继续侮辱我吧。我不在乎你怎么说。只要你给我这笔钱。我不会放弃德园，只要我还没有死，我就不放弃。噢，瑞德，请你给我这笔钱吧。
瑞德：就是我想给也不行。我的钱都在利物浦，不在亚特兰 大。我一动那笔钱，北佬就会闻着味追上来。所以你明白了吗，我亲爱的，你这次真是白白让自己蒙受羞辱了……诀别叫了，你想让北佬听见吗？
思嘉：把你的手拿开，混蛋！你知道我想说什么，你也知道不会借钱给我。可是，可是，你还让我白白地说。
瑞德：我喜欢听你说真话。高兴点，你要是能在我被绞死时来看我，我会在立遗嘱时想到你的。
思嘉：我会来的，我只怕他们不在德园付税之前绞死你。
   
Chapter 8 Raising of the Tax

(Wilkenson, Mr. O'Hara's ex-overseer, comes to Tara with his newly-
married wife. They intend to buy Tara, for they know the "turbulence 
Tara now is in.) 
SCARLETT: Why, Emmy Sladdly EMMY 
SLADDLY: Yes'm, it's me. 
SCARLETT: Stop!
WILKENSON: You haven't forgotten your old overseer, have you? 
Huh? Well, Emmy is Mrs. Wilkenson now... 
SCARLETT: Get off those steps, you trashy wench. Get off this land!
WILKENSON: You can't speak that way to my wife. SCARLETT: 
Why? High time you made her your wife. Who baptized your other 
brats after you killed my mother? 
WILKENSON: We came out here to pay a call. A friendly call, and
talk a little business with old friends. 
SCARLETT: Friends. When were we ever friends with the likes of 
you?
WILKENSON: Still high and mighty ain't you? Well, I
know all about you. I know your father's turned idiot. You
can't pay your taxes. And I come out to offer to buy the
place from you. To make you a right good offer. Emmy's
got a ^hankering to live here.
SCARLETT: Get off this place, you dirty Yankee!
WILKENSON: You bum-trucking, high-flying Irish will
find out who's running things around here when you get
sold out for taxes. I'll buy this place, lock, stock and barrel
and I'll live in it. But I'll wait for the ^sheriff's sale.
SCARLETT: That's all ofTara you'll ever get.
(Scarlett throws the ball to Wilkenson's face. of soil which
Ashyley put in her hand.)
WILKENSON: You'll be sorry for that. We'll be back!
(Mr. O'Hara mounts his horse. In a fame of anger, he tries
to cut the way and catch the Wilkensons.)
Mr. O'HARA: I saw you holding on to the carriage!
SCARLETT: Paw, come back!
Mr.O'HARA: Yankee coward!
SCARLETT: Paw!
(Mr. O'Hara falls down to the ground. He never rises again.
Days after...)
SCARLETT: Oh, Mammie, Mammie.
MAMMIE: You've been brave so long, Miss Scarlett. You
just got to go on being brave. Think about your Paw, like
he used to be.

SCARLETT: I can't think about Paw. I can't think of
anything but that three hundred dollars.
MAMMIE: Ain't no good thinking about that. Miss
Scarlett. Ain't nobody got that much money. Nobody but
that Yankee's and the scallow-wags got that much money
now.
SCARLETT: Rhett!
MAMMIE: Who that? A Yankee?
SCARLETT: Oh, Mammie, I'm so thin and pale and...I
haven't any clothes. Go up to the attic Mammie, and get
down Ma's old box of dress patterns.
MAMMIE: What are you up to in Miss Ellen's fortier?
SCARLETT: You're going to make me a new dress!
MAMMIE: Not with Miss Ellen's fortier, not while I got
breath in my body!
SCARLETT: Great balls of fire, they're my fortiers now.
I'm going to Atlanta for that three hundred dollars, and
I've got to go looking like a queen.
MAMMIE: Who's going to Atlanta with you?
SCARLETT: I'm going alone.
MAMMIE: That's what you think. I'm going to Atlanta
with you, with you and that new dress.
SCARLETT: Now Mammie darling...
MAMMIE: No use to try and sweet talk me Miss Scarlett,
I knows you ever since I put the first pair of diapers on
you. I says I was going to Atlanta with you, and going I is!
(Atlanta prison. Rhett Butler and the prison Major are
playing cards at a table.)
MAN: Sir, there's a lady to see Captain Butler. Says she's your sister.
MAJOR: Another sister? This is a jail, not a "'harem, Captain Butler.
MAN:No, Major, she ain't one of those. This one's got her mammie 
with her.
RHETT: She has? I'd like to see this one, Major, without her 
mammie. MAJOR: Hmm...
RHETT: Let's see, my losses for the afternoon come to what? Hmm... 
three hundred and fourty. My debts do mount up, don't they, Major?
MAJOR: All right, Corporal. Show Captain Butler's sister to his cell.
RHETT: Thank you, Major...excuse me, gentlemen. MAJOR: It's 
hard to be strict with a man who loses money so pleasantly.
(In the jail. Scarlett appears, dressing in beautiful green velvet.)
SCARLETT: Rhett!
RHETT: Scarlett! My dear little sister. (to Corporal) It's all right 
Corporal, my sister has brought me now files or saws. Can I really 
kiss you now? SCARLETT: On the forehead like a good brother. 
RHETT: No thanks, I'll wait and hope for better things. SCARLETT: 
Oh, Rhett, I was so distressed when I heard you were in jail. I simply 
couldn't sleep for thinking. It's not true they're going to hang you.
RHETT: Would you be sorry?
SCARLETT: Oh, Rhett...
RHETT: Well, don't worry. Yeah, The Yankees have
trumped up some charge against me but what they're
really after is my money. They seem to think I made off
with a Confederate treasury.
SCARLETT: Well, did you?
RHETT: What a leading question. Let's not talk about
"sordid things like money. How good of you to come and
see me. And how pretty you look.
SCARLETT: Oh, Rhett, how you do run on teasing a
country girl like me.
RHETT: Thank Heaven's you're not in rags, I'm tired of
seeing women in rags. Turn around. You look good enough
to eat. Prosperous, too.
SCARLETT: Thank you, I've been doing very well.
Everybody's doing well at Tara, only, I got so bored, I just
thought I'd treat myself with to visit to town.
RHETT: You're a heartless creature but that's part of your
charm. Though you've got more charm than the law
allows.
SCARLETT: Now I did come here to talk senseless about
me, Rhett. I came because I was so miserable at the
thought of you in trouble. Oh, I know I was mad at you
the night you left me on the road to Tara, and I still haven't
forgiven you.
RHETT: Oh, Scarlett, don't say that.
SCARLETT: Well, I must admit I might not be alive now. Only for 
you. And when I think of myself with anything I could possibly hope 
for, and not a care in the world, and you where here in this horrid jail. 
And not even a human jail, Rhett, a horse jail. But listen to me, try to 
make jokes when, when I really want to cry. And in a minute I shall 
cry.
RHETT: Scarlett, can it be possible that... 
SCARLETT: Can what be possible, Rhett?
RHETT: That you've grown a woman's heart? A real woman's heart.
SCARLETT: I have Rhett. I know I have. 
RHETT: You know it's worth being in jail just to hear you say that.It's 
well worth it. 
(Rhett grasps Scarlett's hands. And suddenly, he reads the callous skin of her 
hands. This is a pair of hard-working hands.)
You can drop the moonlight and '''magnolia, Scarlett. So things have been 
going well at tara, have they? 
SCARLETT: Yes...RHETT: What have you been doing with your hands? 
SCARLETT: It's just that, I went riding last week without my gloves...
RHETT: These don't belong to a lady, you've been working with 
them like a field hand. Why did you lie to me, and what are you really 
up to? 
SCARLETT: Now Rhett...
RHETT: In another minute, I'd almost believed you'd cared something.
SCARLETT: But I do care!
RHETT: Suppose we get down to the truth. You want something 
from me and you want it badly enough to put on quite a show on your 
velvets. What is it, money? 
SCARLETT: I want three hundred dollars to pay the taxes on Tara. Oh 
Rhett, I did lie to you when I said everything was all right. Things are 
just as bad as they possibly could be. And you've got millions, Rhett. 
RHETT: What collateral are you offering? 
SCARLETT: My ear bobs... 
RHETT: Not interested. 
SCARLETT: Mortgage on Tara... 
RHETT: What would I do with a farm? 
SCARLETT: You wouldn't lose, I'd pay you back after next 
year's cotton.
RHETT: Not good enough. Have you nothing better? 
SCARLETT: You once said you loved me. If you still love me, Rhett...
RHETT: You haven't forgotten that I'm not a marrying man.
SCARLETT: No. I haven't forgotten, RHETT: You're not worth three 
hundred dollars. You'll never mean anything but misery to any man. 
SCARLETT: Go on, insult me, I don't care what you say, only give 
me the money! I won't let Tara go, I can't let it go while there's a 
breath left in my body. Oh, Rhett, won't you please give me the 
money?
RHETT: I couldn't give you the money if I wanted to. My funds are 
in Liverpool, not in Atlanta. If I tried drawing a draft, the Yankees 
would be on me like a duck on a junebug. So you see my dear, 
you've abased yourself to no purpose. Stop it! You want 
the Yankees to see like this? SCARLETT: Take your hands off me, 
you dunk! You know what I am going to say before I started. You 
knew you wouldn't lend me the money and yet, and yet, you let me go 
on.
RHETT: I enjoyed hearing what you had to say. Cheer up, you can 
come to my hanging and I'll remember you in my will.
SCARLETT: I'll come to your hanging. The only thing I'm afraid of is 
they won't hang you in time to pay the taxes on Tara.

（思嘉怒气冲冲地离开监狱。但思嘉和她的新装并未白白到亚特兰大走一遭。她遇见苏・爱伦的情人弗兰克・肯尼迪。）
弗兰克・肯尼迪：难道真是思嘉小姐吗？
思嘉：噢，弗兰克・肯尼迪！
弗兰克：奶妈。
奶妈：见到同乡真高兴。
弗兰克：我不知道你们来了亚特兰大。
思嘉：我也不知道你在这儿。
弗兰克：难道苏・爱伦小姐没有对你讲起我的店吗？ 思嘉：是吗，我不记得了。你开了门店吗？这间？
弗兰克：难道你不打算进来看一下吗（进店中）对高贵女士而言这店不算什么，但我还是很为它骄傲。
思嘉：你没赚大钱吧？
弗兰克：噢，我没怨言。实际上我还挺受鼓舞的。老乡们都说我天生是个商人。很快苏・爱伦小姐和我就可以结婚了。
思嘉：你这么顺利吗？
弗兰克：是的，思嘉小姐。我不是百万富翁，可我也赚了一千多块钱了。
思嘉：你也做木材生意？
弗兰克：是，不过只是副业。
思嘉：副业，弗兰克？全佐治亚的好松木都在亚特兰大周围，而城里面又大兴土木。
弗兰克：但这需要好多钱啊，思嘉小姐。而且．我也想着买一座房子
思嘉：你买房子干什么？
弗兰克：为我和苏・爱伦小姐安居乐业啊。
思嘉：在亚特兰大，你想带她来亚特兰大？那对德园就没多大用处了。
弗兰克：我不太明白你的意思，思嘉小姐。
思嘉：没什么，弗兰克，可不可送我到贝蒂姨妈那？
弗兰克：这让我太荣幸了，思嘉小姐。 思嘉：而且你最好留下来吃晚餐。我想贝蒂姨妈一定会很高兴的，而且我也想和你多聊一聊。
弗：这太让我兴奋了。思嘉小姐。你能告诉我所有，所有关于苏・爱伦小姐的消息吗？怎么了，思嘉小姐？苏・爱伦小姐是不是生病了？
思嘉：噢，没有，没有。我以为她一定已经写信告诉你了呢。我想她一定是羞于告诉你。她该无脸见人，有这么一个忘恩负义的妹妹真可怕。
弗：你一定要告诉我，思嘉小姐。别让我悬着。
思嘉：下个月她要和一个乡下小伙子结婚。她只是厌倦等待了。她怕会做老处女…噢，我真难过这事要由我告诉你。噢，好冷啊，我把手套忘在家了，我可以把手放在你口袋里面吗？
（带着300美元，思嘉以肯尼迪夫人的身份返回德园面对伤透心的苏爱伦以及他人的讶异。）
苏・爱伦：但是媚兰，你不知道她到底干了些什么。她和我的肯尼迪结婚了。他是我的情人，可是她却去和他结婚了。
媚兰：她是为了挽救德园，你要理解她，苏・爱伦。
苏・爱伦：我恨德园，我恨思嘉。我恨德园，更恨思嘉。 （在起居室。）希礼：全是我的错，我应该为了你的税款去大路上抢劫。思嘉：我不会让你去做这种事的。不管怎么样，现在事情解决了。
希：是啊，解决了。你不让我去做任何不名誉的事，但是却允许你把自己卖给一个你不爱的男人。不过，至少你不用再为我这个没用的人操心了。
思嘉：你什么意思？
希礼：我要去纽约。我已经在那儿的一家银行找到一份工作。
思嘉：但是你不能这么做。我，我指望你帮我做木材生意，希礼。我指望你呢。
希礼：思嘉，我对你没什么用的。我对木材生意一无所知。
思嘉：你也不懂银行业务。我要把一半生意给你，希礼。
希礼：你太慷慨了，思嘉。但主要不是这个。如果我接受了你的帮助去了亚特兰大，我就永远没有希望自立了。
思嘉：就为这个？你可以慢慢把这生意买过去。这样它就会成为你自己的，然后……
希礼：不，思嘉。
思嘉：澳，希礼！希礼。 （媚兰走进来。）
媚兰：思嘉，怎么了，思嘉？
思嘉：希礼这么卑鄙可恨。
媚兰：（对希礼）你做了些什么？
希礼：她，她希望我去亚特兰大。
思嘉：去帮我开展木材生意。可他却一点忙也不想帮。
媚兰：你怎么这样没有风度？想一想，希礼，想一想，如果不是思嘉，我早就死在亚特兰大了。可能我们也不会有我们的孩子。当我想到她摘棉花，锄地来养活我们这些人，我就，噢，我亲爱的！
希礼：好吧，媚兰，我去亚特兰大。我敌不过你们两个。
（几个月后。木材生意非常成功。但好景不长。弗兰克・肯尼迪在与几个欺负思嘉的流浪汉的决斗中死去。思嘉很伤心。）奶妈：思嘉小姐，巴特勒上尉想见你。我告诉他你因为伤心，正在床上躺着呢。
思：告诉他，告诉他我马上下来．奶妈。
（在楼下）
奶妈：她说她马上下来。我不知道她为什么要下来，不过她就下来了。
瑞德：您不喜欢我，奶妈。你别争辩，你的确是不喜欢我。 （思嘉下来，引瑞德进起居室。）
瑞德：这不好，思嘉。这些古龙水。
思嘉：真不知道你在说什么。
瑞德：我是说你在喝白兰地，喝了不少。
思嘉：喝了又怎么样？和你有什么关系。
瑞德：别一个人喝闷酒，思嘉。迟早给人发现，这样你的名声就完了。怎么回事？比失去老弗兰克还伤心。
思嘉：噢，瑞德，我真害怕。
瑞德：我不信。你从来不知道害怕。
思嘉：我现在害怕了。我怕死，怕去地狱。
瑞德：你蛮健康的，而且并不一定有地狱。
思嘉：噢，有的，我知道有的。我从小就知道有。
瑞德：我没有资格评论你小时候受的教育。告诉我你做错什么了，让地狱打开大门了？
思嘉：我从一开始就不该和弗兰克结婚。他是苏・爱伦的男友。他爱的是她，不是我。我让他痛苦。是我害了他，是的，是我，是我害了他。噢，瑞德这是我第一次对自己的所作所为感到后悔。 瑞德：来，擦擦眼睛。你如果有机会再来一遍，你还会这么做的。你象一个贼，一点不为偷东西行窃伤心，而是为了要去监狱痛心疾首。
思嘉：我真庆幸妈妈已经死了。她死了便看不见我的行为了。我总希望能跟她一样。平和，仁慈……可是一下子我就这么让人失望。
瑞德：你知道么，思嘉，你哭得太狂热了。所以，我来换个话题，说说我的来意。
思嘉：说完就走。什么事，
瑞德：就是我再也不能没有你了。
思嘉：你真是太没有教养了，这种时候来说这个……
瑞德：我下定决心，思嘉。我在十二橡树看见你的第一眼，就知道你是唯一适合我的女人。现在你有了你的木材作坊和弗兰克的钱，你不会象我在监狱那会一样来求我了。所以，看来我要娶你了。
思嘉：我从来没听过这么没情调的话。
瑞德：如果我跪下来，是否更有说服力呢？
思嘉：放开我，你这个无赖，快走开。
瑞德：原谅我，我情感的放任吓着你了，我亲爱的思嘉，我是说我亲爱的肯尼迪太太。不过你不会没有注意到，在过去这段时间里，我对你的友谊已经发展成为一种更深的感情。一种更美丽，更纯洁，更神圣的感情--允许我给它一个名字吗？可以叫它"爱"吗？ 思嘉：快站起来，我不喜欢你无聊的笑话。
瑞德：这是很荣幸的求婚，在这个我认为最适当的时候。我不能等一辈子，看着你嫁完又嫁。
思嘉：你太暴躁、太自负了。我想我们的谈话到此为止吧。而且，我不会再结婚了。
瑞德：不，你会的。你会嫁给我的。
思嘉：你…・你？我不爱你，我也不想再让谁娶了去。
瑞：你想过没有，为乐趣而结婚？
思嘉：结婚，乐趣？真无聊，你是说男人的乐趣吧。嘘，别让外面的人听见了。
瑞德：你先是嫁给一个孩子，又嫁给一个老头。为什么不找个年龄相当的试一下呢？对女人很有经验的。
思嘉：你简直是傻瓜，瑞德・巴特勒。你知道我一直爱着另一个男人。
瑞德：不要说了，你听到了吗？思嘉，不要说了，不要再讲那种活了。
思嘉：瑞德，别，我要晕了。
瑞德：我希望如此，应该让你这样。你知道的那些傻瓜都不会这样吻你。你的查理，或者弗兰克，或者是你那个傻瓜希 礼・威尔克斯。
说你要和我结婚。答应我，答应我。
思嘉：是的。
瑞德：说话算话吗？你会不会又要收回？
思嘉：不会。
   Chapter 9 Scarlett's Second Marriage

(Scarlett leaves the jail in burning anger. But the visit of
Scarlett and her new dress to Atlanta is not a complete
"futility. She meets Frank Kennedy, Sue Ellen's beau.)
Frank: Surely it can't be Miss Scarlett!
SCARLETT: Why, Frank Kennedy!
FRANK: And Mammie...
MAMMIE: It sure is good to see home folks.
FRANK: I didn't know you were in Atlanta.
SCARLETT: I didn't know you were.
FRANK: Didn't Miss Sue Ellen tell you about my store?
SCARLETT: Did she, I don't remember. Have you a store? This?
FRANK: Won't you come in, look around a bit? (Into the store) I 
don't suppose it looks like much to a lady, but I can't help being 
proud of it. SCARLETT: You're not making money? 
FRANK: Well, I can't complain. In fact I'm mighty encouraged. 
Folks tell me I'm just a born merchant. It won't be long now before 
Miss Sue Ellen and I can marry. 
SCARLETT: Well , you're doing as well as all that? 
FRANK: Yes, I am. Miss Scarlett. I'm no millionaire yet, but I have 
cleared a thousand dollars already. 
SCARLETT: And lumber too. 
FRANK: Well, that's only a sideline. 
SCARLETT: A sideline, Frank? With all the good Georgia pine 
around Atlanta, and all this building going on? 
FRANK: Well, all that takes money, Miss Scarlett, and, I got to be 
thinking about buying a home. 
SCARLETT: What would you want a home for? 
FRANK: For Miss Sue Ellen and me to set up housekeeping.
SCARLETT: Here in Atlanta. You'd want to bring her to Atlanta, 
wouldn't you? There wouldn't be much help in that for Tara.
FRANK: I don't rightly know what you mean, Miss Scarlett.
SCARLETT: I don't mean a thing. Frank, how'd you like to drive me 
out to my Aunt Pitty's? 
Frank: Oh, nothing could give me more pleasure, Miss Scarlett.
SCARLETT: I think you'd better stay for supper, too. I'm sure Aunt 
Pitty would be agreeable and I know I'd like a good long visit with 
you.
FRANK: Oh, you act on me just like a ^tonic, Miss Scarlett. And will 
you tell me all the news, all the news of Miss Sue Ellen? What's the 
matter, Miss Scarlett? Miss Sue Ellen's not ill, is she?
SCARLETT: Oh, no, no. I thought surely she had written you. I guess 
she was ashamed to write to you. She should be ashamed. Oh how 
awful to have such a mean sister. 
FRANK: You must tell me, Miss Scarlett. Don't leave me on the tenderhooks.
SCARLETT: Well, she's going to marry one of the county boys next 
month. She just got tired of waiting and was afraid she'd be an old 
maid and...Oh, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you. Oh, it's cold, and I 
left my muff at home. Would you mind if I put my hand in your 
pocket? 
(Scarlett returns to Tara as Mrs. Kennedy, with 300 dollars, to face 
Sue Ellen's broken heart and the astonishment of the other people.)
SUE ELLEN: But Melanie, you don't realize what she's done. 
She's gone and married my Mr. Kennedy! He's my beau and she's 
gone and married him. 
MELANIE: She did it to save Tara, you must understand that, Sue Ellen.
SUE ELLEN: I hate Tara. And I hate Scarlett. She's the only thing I 
hate worse than Tara!
(In the living room.)
ASHLEY: It's all my fault. I should have commited highway robbery 
to get that tax money for you. 
SCARLETT: I couldn't let you do anything like that, and anyway, 
it's done now.
ASHLEY: Yes, it's done now. You wouldn't let me do anything 
dishonorable yet you'd sell yourslef in marraige to a man you didn't 
love. Well, at least you won't have to worry about my helplessness 
anymore. 
SCARLETT: What do you mean? 
ASHLEY: I'm going to New York..I've arranged to get a position in 
a bank there.
SCARLETT: But you can't do that! I've counted on you to help me 
start a lumber business Ashley and, I counted on you.
ASHLEY: Scareltt, I wouldn't be any good to you, I don't know 
anything about the lumber business. 
SCARLETT: You know as much as you do about banking, and 
I'd give you half the business Ashley. 
ASHLEY: That's generous of you Scarlett. But it isn't that. If I go to 
Atlanta and take help from you again, I'd bury forever any hope of 
standing alone. SCARLETT: Oh, is that all? Well, you could 
gradually buy the business, and then it would be your own, and 
then...
ASHLEY: No Scarlett. SCARLETT: Oh, 
Ashley! Ashley
(Melanie walkes in.)
MELANIE: Scarlett. Scarlett, what is it?
SCARLETT: Ashely is so mean and hateful.
MELANIE: (to Ashley )What have you done?
ASHLEY: She, she wanted me to go to Atlanta.
SCARLETT: To help me start me my lumber business,
and he won't lift a finger to help me.
MELANIE: Why how ^unchivalrous of you. Why think
Ashley, think. If it hadn't of been for Scarlett, I'd have
died in Atlanta, and maybe we wouldn't have had little
Beau, and, when I think of picking cotton and plowing
just to keep food in our mouths, I could just, oh, my darling!
ASHLEY: All right, Melanie. I'll go to Atlanta. I can't fight
you both.
(Months passed. The lumber business is a great success.
But good times don't last long. Frank Kennedy died in a
fight against some tramps, for their insult on Scarlett.
Scarlett is very sad.)
MAMMIE: Miss Scarlett. Captain Butler here to see you.
I told him you was ^prostrate with grief.
SCARLETT: Tell him, tell him I'll be right down, Mammie.
(Downstairs.)
MAMMIE: She says she's coming. I don't know why she's
coming, but she's a-coming.
RHETT: You don't like me Mammie. Now don't you argue
with me, you don't, you really don't like me.
(Scarlett comes down, and shows Rhett into the living
room.)
RHETT: It's no good Scarlett.
SCARLETT: what?
RHETT: The cologne.
SCARLETT: I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
RHETT: I mean you've been drinking. Brandy. Quite a
lot.
SCARLETT: Well, what if I had? Is that any of your affair?
RHETT: Don't drink alone, Scarlett. People always find
out. And it ruins reputation. What is it? This is more
than losing old Frank.
SCARLETT: Oh, Rhett. I am so afraid.
RHETT: I don't believe it. You've never been afraid in your
life.
SCARLETT: I'm afraid now. I'm afraid of dying, of going
to Hell.
RHETT: You look pretty healthy. And maybe there isn't
any Hell.
SCARLETT: Oh, there is. I know there is. I was raised on
it.
RHETT: Well, far be it for me to question the teachings of
childhood. Tell me what you've done that Hell yawns
before you.
SCARLETT: I ought never to have married Frank to begin
with. He was Sue Ellen's beau and he loved her not me.
And I made him miserable. And I killed him. Yes, I did,
I'd killed him. Oh, Rhett. For the first time, I'm finding
out what it is to feel sorry for something I've done.
RHETT: Here, dry your eyes. If you had it to do all over again, you'd 
do it no differently. You're like the thief who isn't the least bit sorry 
he stole but he's terribly, terribly sorry he's going to jail.
SCAELETT: I'm glad ma is dead. I'm glad she's dead so she can't see 
me. I always wanted to be like her, calm and kind and...and suddenly 
I've turned out disappointing. 
RHETT: You know what, Scarlett? I think you're on the verge of a 
crying jag. So I'll change the subject and say what I came to say.
SCARLETT: Say it, then get out! What is it? 
RHETT: That I can't go on any longer without you. 
SCARLETT: Oh, you really are the most ill-bred man to come here at 
a time like this...
RHETT: I made up my mind you were the only woman for me,
Scarlett, the first day I saw you at Twelve Oaks. Now that you've got 
your lumber mill and Frank's money, you won't come to me as you 
did at the jail. So I see I shall have to marry you.
SCARLETT: I never heard of such bad taste. 
RHETT: Would you be more convinced if I fell to my knees? 
SCARLETT: Turn me loose, you varlet and get out of here. 
RHETT: Forgive me for startling you with the impetuosity of my 
sentiments, my dear Scarlett, I mean my dear Mrs. Kennedy. 
But it cannot have escaped your notice that for some time past, 
the friendship I have felt for you has ripened into a deeper feeling. 
A feeling more beautiful, more pure, more sacred... 
dare I name it? Can it be love?
SCARLETT: Get up off your knees, I don't like your common jokes.
RHETT: This is an honorable proposal of marraige, made in what I 
consider a most opportune moment. I can't go all my life waiting to 
catch you between husbands. 
SCARLETT: You're coarse and you're conceited. And I think 
this conversation's gone far enough. Besides, I shall never marry again.
RHETT: Oh yes, you will. And you'll marry me 
SCARLETT: You...you? I don't love you. And I don't like being married.
RHETT: Did you ever think of marrying just for fun? 
RHETT: Oh yes, you will. And you'll marry me 
SCARLETT: You...you? I don't love you. And I don't like being married.
RHETT: Did you ever think of marrying just for fun? SCARLETT: 
Marriage, fun? Fiddle-dee-dee. Fun for men you mean. Hush, do you 
want them to hear you outside? 
RHETT: You've been married to a boy and an old man. Why not try a
husband at the right age? With a way with women?
SCARLETT: You're a fool, Rhett Butler. When you know I shall 
always love another man.
RHETT: Stop it. You hear me Scarlett, stop it. No more of that talk.
SCARLETT: Rhett don't, I shall faint. 
RHETT: And I want you to faint. This is what you were meant for. 
None of the fools you've ever known have kissed you like this, have 
they? Your Charles or your Frank or your stupid Ashley. Say you're 
going to marry me. Say yes. Say yes. 
SCARLETT: Yes.
RHETT: Are you sure you meant it? You don't want to take it back? 
SCARLETT: No.

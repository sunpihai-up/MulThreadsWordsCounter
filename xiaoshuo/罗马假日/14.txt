 
 
Roman Holiday
PART 14

(Joe enters his apartment, takes off his jacket and closes the door. Inside, the radio is on, playing soft piano music. An announcer comes on: "This is the American Hour from Rome, continuing our musical selections".)
(In the bathroom, Ann gets herself ready, dressed in a bedrobe. Looking in the mirror, she smooths her hair over.)
(She goes outside, standing beside the closed door. Joe, preparing a drink, greets her with a smile.)

JOE
(with a laugh)
Everything ruined? 

ANN
No. They'll be dry in a minute. 

JOE
Suits you--you should always wear my clothes. 

ANN
Seems I do 

(Joe laughs.)

JOE
(giving a her a glass of wine)
I thought a little wine might be good. 

ANN
Shall I cook something? 

JOE
No kitchen; nothing to cook; I always eat out. 

ANN
Do you like that? 

JOE
Well, life isn't always what one likes--
(pauses)
is it? 

ANN
No, it isn't 

(Ann sits down.)

JOE
Tired? 

ANN
A little. 

JOE
You've had quite a day. 

ANN
A wonderful day 

(she smiles as the radio announcer comes on.)

RADIO ANNOUNCER
This is the American Hour, from Rome, broadcasting a special news bulletin in English and Italian. Tonight there is no further word 

(Ann stands up, walking to the radio; Joe stands still, his back to her)
from the bedside of Princess Ann in Rome, where she was taken ill yesterday, on the last leg of her European goodwill tour. This has given rise to rumours that her condition may be serious, which is causing alarm and anxiety among the people in her country. 

(The radio starts to repeat the bulletin in Italian so Ann switches it off.)

ANN
The news can wait till tomorrow. 

JOE
Yes. 

ANN
(she walks to him)
May I have a little more wine? 

(He pours her some more)
Sorry I couldn't cook us some dinner. 

JOE
(as Ann drinks from the glass)
Did you learn how in school? 

ANN
Mmmm, I'm a good cook; I could earn my living at it. I can sew too, and clean a house, and iron--I learned to do all those things, I just haven't had the chance 

(slowing, turning away)
to do it for anyone. 

JOE
Well, looks like I'll have to move; and get myself a place with a kitchen. 

ANN
(she turns around to look at him, heart-broken)
Yes 

(they look at each other for a moment then Ann looks down and drinks the rest of her wine. Ann chokes back her sorrow)
I... will have to go now. 

(She stands for a moment, Joe looking at her, then runs into his arms, crying on his shoulder.)

JOE
(comforting her)
Anya... there's... something that I want to tell you. 

ANN
No, please 

(she looks at him and kisses him)
nothing. 

(They hold each other for a moment then Ann looks down)
I must go and get dressed. 
(Ann walks to the bathroom. Joe stands with his back to her, heart-broken. He walks over to pick up his jacket and puts it on.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Solemnly, without speaking, Joe drives Ann through Rome.)

ANN
(looking straight ahead)
Stop at the next corner, please. 

JOE
'K. 

(He slows down, stopping at a corner and leans forward to see the Embassy gate visible down the street)
Here? 

ANN
(looking out her window)
Yes. 

(Looking down, without looking at him)
I have to leave you now. I'm going to that corner 

(she looks out,)
there, and turn. You must stay in the car and drive away. Promise not to watch me go beyond the corner. Just drive away and leave me, as I leave you. 

JOE
(solemnly)
Alright. 

ANN
(keeping back the tears)
I don't know how to say goodbye. I can't think of any words. 

JOE
Don't try. 
(They look at each other and she throws her self into his arms, holding her tight. They kiss, passionately, then hold each other for a few more moments and Ann cries against his shoulder. They release, enough for her to turn around to look back down the street, then she looks at back him. They manage a smile at each other and then Ann looks down, unable to stay the inevitable. Turning away from him, she opens the door and gets out. Without looking back she starts off down the street, her walk turning into a run. Joe watches her as she disappears round the corner. Joe looks out at the empty street toward the gate and looking as if he might go after her but, after a pause he looks away, glumly, then switches on the engine and drives off.)
(In the Embassy. Princess Ann stands in a large room across from the others in their bedclothes: Ambassador; the Countess, who is upset, wiping her nose with a handkerchief; and the General, who stands grim-faced.)

AMBASSADOR
Your Royal Highness: twenty-four hours--they can't all be blank. 

ANN
They are not. 

AMBASSADOR
But what explanation am I to offer Their Majesties? 

ANN
I was indisposed. I am better. 

AMBASSADOR
Ma'am: you must appreciate that I have my duty to perform, just as Your Royal Highness has Her duty--. 

ANN
Your Excellency: I trust you will not find it necessary to use that word again. Were I not completely aware of my duty to my family and my country, I would not have come tonight. 

(The look at her, in silence; after a pause, grimly)
Or indeed ever again. 

(Ann walks across the room)
Now, since I understand we have a very full schedule today, you have my permission to withdraw. 

(They stand for a moment, then bow and walk away. At the door, the Countess takes a tray from a servant)
No milk and crackers. 

(The Countess gives them back, about to shut the door)
That will be all, thank you, Countess. 

(The Countess bows in respect and then goes out, closing the door.)
(Alone in the room the Princess walks slowly over to a window, looking out over the city in silence.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(The next day, Joe sits in his apartment, looking out of his window over the town. There is a knock at the door and Joe looks up, hopefully. The knocking persists and he walks to the door slowly and opens it, then turns around in disappointment.)

HENNESSY
(bursting in)
Joe, is it true: did you really get it? 

JOE
(turning back to him, hands in pockets)
Did I get what? 

HENNESSY
The Princess story, the exclusive: did you get it? 

JOE
No, no, I didn't get it 

(he turns away.)

HENNESSY
What? But that's impossible! 

JOE
Have a cup of coffee or something? 

HENNESSY
(waving his finger at him)
Joe, you can't hold out on me. 

JOE
Who's holding out on you? 

HENNESSY
You are. 

JOE
(absently, pretending to busy himself with something on the desk)
What are you talking about? 

HENNESSY
I know too much: First you come into my office and ask about an exclusive on the Princess; next, you disappear; then I get the rumour from my contact at the Embassy that the Princess isn't sick at all and she's out on the town. 

JOE
What kind of a newspaper man are you? You believe every two-bit rumour that comes your way? 

HENNESSY
Yeah? And a lot of other rumours: about a shindig at a barge down by the river 

(Joe looks up, his eyes brightening at the recollection)
and the arrest of eight Secret Service men from a country which shall be nameless. And then comes of news of the lady's miraculous recovery. It all adds up! And don't think by playing hard-to-get that you're raised the price of that story: a deal's a deal! 

(Pushing him out of the way, rummaging through the papers on his desk)
Now, come on, come on, come on: where is that story? 

JOE
I have no story 

(he pushes past him, walking to the table with the wine on)

HENNESSY
(as Joe pours a drink)
Then what was the idea of--. 

IRVING
(loudly, approaching from outside)
Joe! 

(He bursts in, carrying a large envelope)
Man, wait till you see these! 

JOE
Irving. 

IRVING
(walking to Mr. Hennessy, holding out the packet)
Hiya, Mr. Henne-- oh, you got here at the right time. (
JOE
Irving.) Wait till you get a look at--
(Joe discreetly throws his drink, all over Irving.)
What's the idea?! 

JOE
What do you mean, charging in and spilling things all over my place. 

IRVING
Who's spilling? 

JOE
You did--I spoke to you about that once before, don't you remember? 

IRVING
Joe, look at my pants! 

JOE
(pulling him by the arm to the bathroom)
Yeah, you better come in here and dry 'em off, Irving. 

IRVING
(protesting, pulling away from him)
Aww, knackers to that. 

(Smiling)
Hey, did you tell him about Smithy? 

JOE
Irving. 

HENNESSY
Smithy? 

IRVING
Oh ho! Mr. Hennessy (JOE Irving.), wait till you--
(Joe trips him as he walks to Mr. Hennessy.)

JOE
There you go again, Irving. 

IRVING
(getting up, steaming)
Joe. Listen, th--. 

JOE
Hey, alright, save that till later; you're here early anyway. Why don't you go home and 
(shave!)

IRVING
(putting a hand on his beard)
Shave? 

JOE
Yeah, or else keep quiet till Mr. Hennessy and I are finished talking. 

HENNESSY
(walking over, putting his hat on)
Hey, what kind of a routine is that? What are you guys up to? 

(Hands on hips)
Who's Smithy? 

JOE
(quickly)
Oh, he's a guy that we met; you wouldn't care for him. 

HENNESSY
(grabbing the envelope from Irving)
What am I supposed to look at? 

JOE
(quickly, grabbing the envelope back)
Oh, just a couple of Irving's dames; you, you wouldn't like 'em. 

(Smiling; opening the envelope)
Er, maybe you would... 

HENNESSY
(stopping him)
Don't change the subject! When you came back into my office, yesterday--. 

JOE
Yeah, I know, yesterday at noon I thought I had a lead, but I was wrong! That's all there is to it; there is no story 

(Irving looks at him, perplexed.)

HENNESSY
Ok; she's holding the press interview today, same time, same place--maybe that's one story you can get. 

(He walks to the door, turning back, pointing a finger at him)
And you owe me five hundred bucks!

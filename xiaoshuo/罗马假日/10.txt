PART 10

ANN
(trying to hand them back)
No money. 

FLOWER MAN
No? 

ANN
No. 

(He replies further, in Italian.)
I'm sorry, I've really no money. 

FLOWER MAN
(Some Italian,)
if you no, eh? 

(Some Italian.)

ANN
Look 

(she reaches for her money, showing it to him. Reluctantly, he takes the flowers back)
I'm sorry. 
(Feeling sorry for her, the flower man pulls a flower out and gives it to her. She offers him her money but he waves his hand, telling her in Italian that she can keep it.)

ANN
(thanking him)
Grazzi, grazzi. 

(She walks away.)
(As Joe watches her from across the street she sits down on one of the ornamentations which divide the width of the steps, licking her icecream. Joe runs up the opposite side, out of view, and then walks across the width of the steps, behind her. He walks down the steps towards her, and walking past her, looks round pretending that he has just noticed her.)

JOE
Weeell, it's you! 

ANN
(looking up at him, smiling)
Yes, Mr. Bradley! 

JOE
(looking at her hair)
Or is it? 

ANN
Do you like it? 

JOE
(Sitting down beside her)
Yeah... very much. So that was your mysterious appointment? 

ANN
Mr. Bradley: I have a confession to make. 

JOE
Confession? 

ANN
Yes, I... ran away last night, from school. 

JOE
Oh, what was the matter: trouble with the teacher? 

ANN
No, nothing like that. 

JOE
Well, you don't just run away from school for nothing. 

ANN
Well, it were only meant to be for an hour or two. They gave me something last night to make me sleep. 

JOE
(he smiles, realising)
Oh, I see. 

ANN
(looking down at the street she finishes her icecream, rubbing her hands clean)
Now I'd better get a taxi and go back. 

JOE
Well, look: before you do, why don't you take a little time for yourself? 

ANN
(shaking her head, unsure)
It may be another hour. 

JOE
(enthusiastically)
Live dangerously: take the whole day! 

ANN
I could do some of the things I've always wanted to. 

JOE
Like what? 

ANN
Oh, you can't imagine... I'd, I'd like to do 
(just)
whatever I'd like, the whole day long! 

(She laughs.)

JOE
You mean, things like having your hair cut? Eating gelato? 

ANN
Yes, and I'd, 

(looking down to the street)
I'd like to sit at a sidewalk cafe; and look in shop windows; walk in the rain! 

(Joe looks at the blue sky doubtfully)
Have fun, and maybe some excitement. It doesn't seem much to you, does it? 

JOE
It's great. Tell you what: why don't we do all those things--together. 

ANN
But don't you have to work? 

JOE
Work? 

(Standing up)
No! Today's gonna be a holiday. 

ANN
(playfully)
But you'll want to do a lot of silly things. 

JOE
(taking her hand)
Don't I? First wish: one sidewalk cafe, coming right up--I know just the place: 

(he gently pulls her up, setting off down the steps)
Rocca's. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Joe and Ann sit at a table at Rocca's, watching the traffic go past. Joe sits watching as she eats a bread roll.)

JOE
What'll the people at school say when they see your new haircut? 

ANN
(laughing)
They'll have a fit. What would they say if they knew I'd spent the night in your room? 

JOE
(he looks around self-consciously, leaning closer, playfully)
Well, er, I'll tell you what: you don't tell your folks and I won't tell mine. 

ANN
(smiling)
It's a pact. 

JOE
Now, what would you like to drink? 

ANN
(casually)
Champagne, please. 

JOE
(pausing, slightly taken aback at her extravagance; to the waiter walking past)
Er, commerierie*, er... 

WAITER
(bending down, inbetween Joe and Ann)
[Italian], senor? 

JOE
Champagne. 

(He says something in Italian.)
Well, er, champagne 

(Italian)
for the senorina and er, cold coffee for me. 

(The waiter acknowledges in Italian, bows then leaves.)

JOE
Must be quite a life you have in that school--champagne for lunch. 

ANN
Only on special occasions. 

JOE
For instance? 

ANN
The last was my father's anniversary. 

JOE
Wedding? 

ANN
No, it was.. 

(hesitating)
the fortieth anniversary of umm...the day he got his job. 

JOE
Forty years on the job; what do you know about that... 

(Probing her further)
What does he do? 

ANN
(thinking, cautiously)
Well...mostly you might call it...public relations. 

JOE
Oh, well, that's hard work. 

ANN
Yes, I wouldn't care for it. 

JOE
Does he? 

ANN
I've...heard him complain about it. 

JOE
Why doesn't he quit? 

ANN
Well, people in that line of work almost never do quit--unless it's actually unhealthy for them to continue. 

JOE
(as the waiter delivers the drinks)
Uh-huh. Well, here's to his health then. 

ANN
(the waiter places a straw by her wine glass)
You know: that's what everybody says. 

JOE
(after they drink)
It's alright? 

ANN
(sitting back in her chair, relaxing, playing with the straw)
Yes, thank you. What is your work? 

JOE
(now he stammers nervously)
Oh, I'm er, in the selling game. 

ANN
Really? how interesting. 

JOE
Uh-huh. 

ANN
What do you sell? 

JOE
(he looks blank for a moment then, on hearing a horse in the street passing by, looks up at it; turning to her)
Er, fertilizer; er, chemicals, you know? Chemicals--stuff like that. 

(Ann is somewhat unconvinced then, putting the straw in her mouth, blows the wrapper off. Joe looks up as it flies over the table. He smiles at Ann who laughs, very pleased with herself, holding the wrapper in her mouth. Joe looks up, brightly; standing up, shaking his hand as irving comes over.)
Irving! Well, am I glad to see you. 

IRVING
(jokingly)
Why, did you forget your wallet? 

JOE
(without laughing)
Er, pull up a chair, Irving; sit down with us here. 

IRVING
Aren't you gonna introduce me? 

JOE
Er, yes, this is a very good friend of mine, Irving Radovich; 

(she presents her hand; they shake)
Anya: Irving. 

IRVING
(still holding her hand)
Anya...? 

ANN
Smith. 

IRVING
(playfully; pulling up a chair from the next table to use)
Oh, hiya Smithy. 

ANN
(politely)
Charmed 

(she looks at Joe a little nervously as he puts the chair down next to her; Irving nods to Joe, impressed at her manner.)

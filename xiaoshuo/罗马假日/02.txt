PART 2


ANN
(screaming at the Countess)
STOP!!! 

(Looking away, her hair covering her face)
Please stop! stop...! 

COUNTESS
(retrieving the tray)
It's alright, dear, it didn't spill 

(she places the tray on the table.)

ANN
I don't care if it's spilled or not. I don't care if I 

(throws her head into the pillow)
drown in it! 

COUNTESS
(putting her hands on her shoulders to comfort her)
My dear, you're ill. I'll send for Doctor Bonnachoven. 

ANN
(turning over, facing the opposite way)
I don't want Doctor Bonnachoven; please let me die in peace! 

COUNTESS
You're not dying. 

ANN
(facing the Countess)
Leave me. 

(Sitting up, shouting at her)
Leave me! 

COUNTESS
It's nerves; control yourself Ann. 

ANN
(throwing herself on the pillow, beating it with her fist)
I don't want to! 

COUNTESS
(standing up straight, speaking with authority)
Your Highness 

(Ann continues blubbing.)
I'll get Doctor Bonnachoven 

(she heads for the door.)

ANN
(looking up as she leaves)
It's no use; I'll be dead before he gets here 

(she gives a defiant blub.)
(Later, the Countess enters the bedchamber, followed by Doctor Bonnachoven and the General. They walk to her bed and the doctor looks at Ann, who doesn't move.)

DOCTOR
(to the Countess, puzzled)
She is asleep. 

COUNTESS
She was in hysterics three minutes ago, Doctor. 

DOCTOR
(he puts his Doctor's bag on the table and bends over to her; quietly)
Are you asleep, ma'am? 

ANN
(without moving)
No! 

DOCTOR
Oh. 

(He feels her forehead then takes a thermometer from his bag)
I'll only disturb Your Royal Highness a moment, ah? 

ANN
I'm very ashamed, Doctor Bonnachoven; I-
(the Doctor places the thermometer in her mouth)
suddenly I was crying. 

DOCTOR
(reassuring)
To cry--a perfectly normal thing to do. 

GENERAL
It most important she be calm and relaxed for the press conference, Doctor. 

ANN
Don't worry, Doctor: I-
(takes the thermometer out)
I'll be calm and relaxed and I-I'll bow and I'll smile and- I'll improve trade relations and I, and I will.. 

(she throws herself onto the pillow, in hysterics again.)

COUNTESS
There she goes again. Give her something, Doctor, please. 

DOCTOR
(holding up a syringe from the bag)
Uncover her arm, please, hmm? 
(The Countess uncovers her arm as the General looks away.)

ANN
(calming down; without looking up)
What's that? 

DOCTOR
Sleep and calm. This will relax you and make Your Highness feel a little happy. It's a new drug, quite harmless. 

(As he injects her the General faints behind them, unnoticed)
There. 

ANN
I don't feel any different. 

DOCTOR
You will; it may take a little time to take hold. Just now, lie back, ah? 

ANN
Can I keep just one light on? 

DOCTOR
Of course. Best thing I know is to do exactly what you wish for a while. 

ANN
(smiling)
Thank you, Doctor. 

COUNTESS
(the Countess looks round at the General on the floor)
Oh, the General! Doctor, quick! 

DOCTOR
Oh! 

ANN
(sitting up)
Hah! 

(she puts her hand over her mouth, covering her smile.)

GENERAL
(embarrassed; straightening his bedrobe)
I'm perfectly alright. 

(To the Princess)
Goodnight, ma'am. 

(He bows and leaves.)

DOCTOR
(bowing, smiling at the Princess)
Goodnight, ma'am. 

ANN
Goodnight, Doctor. 
(The Doctor leaves, followed by the Countess, who turns off the light and, looking back at the Princess, shuts the door behind her.)
(Alone, the Princess looks around the large room at the lavish, ancient ornamentation on the ceiling and the huge sculpted headboard. She lies back, and then, remembering, eagerly climbs out of bed and runs to the window. She looks out longingly at the dancing below, the breeze blowing in her face then out over the city, the buildings lit up in the night far in the distance. Thinking, she looks back at the door and then back out the window, then she runs to her wardrobe, and starts rummaging in the clothes hung there.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Later, dressed in a plain white blouse and skirt and picking up her gloves from the dresser, she peers out the door of the bedchambers. She sees a guard sat at the end of the wall stir in his semi-sleep. Pausing as she closes the door, she goes out of the side window onto the balcony outside. She walks along to the edge of the adjacent balcony, jumping down with a slight noise onto the ground. Glancing furtively around she goes inside to a large, empty room. She pauses for moment to look around on either side and then continues. Going through the door she finds herself on a corridor upstairs, encircling the large central area. She runs along to the end, turning the corner and then onto the other side. She continues on, reaches a staircase and goes down it towards the exit.)
(Outside, still in the grounds of the Embassy, she runs along a courtyard area. The shadow of a man walking appears where she has just come from but she reaches safety at the other end before he can see her.)
(Running through the buildings further she pauses, her back against a wall. Looking round the corner she sees a man jump out of a small supply truck. While he is gone she runs over and quietly hops into the back of the truck. The man comes back and throws a couple of bags into the back where she is hiding. He then gets in, starts the motor, and drives off. Guards at the entrace of the Embassy grounds open the doors and the little truck drives out. Ann peers back over the top of a bag to see the guards closing the doors again as the Embassy recede into the distance. She looks round with delight, moving the bag out of the way, leaning her arm on some goods to see out the back better. She watches the truck go past a sidewalk cafe, busy with people, then waves to a couple driving behind on a scooter; the woman waves back at her. The goods rattle in the back as the truck bounces around, and Ann rests on a box, closing her eyes.)
(The truck continues through the city but Ann is awakened when the truck stops for a couple walking across the street in front. As it is stopped she hops out, running to the footpath as the truck screeches away. She leans against a tree, yawning then continues on.)
(Crossing a street, she walks straight across the passenger cabin of a horse-drawn carriage parked alongside the pavement, to the bewilderment of the passengers and driver. The cab drives away as Ann continues on.)
(A light pours from the window of a room on the second floor of the building the carriage was parked in front of...)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Inside the room are sat Joe Bradley, Irving Radovich, and several other men around a poker table.)

Without lookin'.

(Joe looks at him suspiciously. Irving rubs his beard but stays unemotional. Joe places his money in the pool.)

(laying his cards down)
Two pairs. 

JOE
Oh, well I got three 
(shy)
little sevens.

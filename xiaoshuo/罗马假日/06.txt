PART 6

HENNESSY
Two. 

JOE
The er, direct and the...indirect. 

HENNESSY
Oh, remarkable. 

JOE
Naturally she thought that the indirect would not be as...direct...as the direct. That is, not right away. Later on, of course, well, nobody knows. 

HENNESSY
Well, well, well; that was a shrewd observation! They fool you you know, these royal kids; they've got a lot more on the ball than we suspect. 

(Looking at the paper again)
How did she feel about the future friendship of nations? 

JOE
Youth. 

HENNESSY
Yep? 

JOE
She felt that, er 

(nervously walking around the desk, sitting on the corner,)
the youth of the world must lead the way to a better.. 

(he nervously slides a piece of Hennessy's desk equipment a few inches)
world. 

HENNESSY
Hmm-hmm, 

(sliding it back)
original. Er, by the way, what was she wearing? 

JOE
(he pauses blankly)
Oh, you mean what did she have on? 

HENNESSY
(chuckling)
Well, that's usually what it means. 

(Joe nervously adjusts his collar, getting up off the desk again)
Er, what's the matter, is it a little warm in here for you? 

JOE
(walking back to the front of the desk)
No, no, I just hurried over here. 

HENNESSY
Oh, naturally, with a story of these dimensions. Did you say she was wearing gray? 

JOE
No, I didn't say that. 

HENNESSY
Well, she usually wears gray. 

JOE
Oh well, er, it was a...kind of a gray. 

HENNESSY
Oh, I think I know the dress you mean; it has a gold collar--. 

JOE
That's the one, that's the one (HENNESSY smiling, sitting back in agreement That's it.) Yeah, I didn't know exactly how to describe it but that's it, yeah. 

HENNESSY
I think you described it very well. 

(His expression changes as he sits forward, standing up dramatically)
--In view of the fact that Her Highness was taken violently ill at three o'clock this morning, put to bed with a high fever, and has had all her appointments for today cancelled in toto! 

JOE
(helplessly)
In toto? 

HENNESSY
Yes, Mr. Bradley: in toto. 

JOE
(swallows audibly)
Certainly pretty hard to swallow. 

HENNESSY
In view of the fact that you just left her, of course. But here it is, Mr. Bradley 

(picking up a paper:)
all over the front page of every newspaper in Rome! 

(he hands him the paper.)

JOE
Alright, alright; I overslept. It can happen to anybody! 

HENNESSY
If you ever get up early enough to read a morning paper you might discover little news events 

(pointing to the article in the paper)
--little items of general interest 

(Joe looks at the paper and stares at the picture of the Princess--the same woman as in his apartment but in a regal gown, necklace and tiara)
that might prevent you in the future from getting immersed in such a gold-plated, triple-decked, star-spangled lies as you have just told me! 

(As Joe continues to stare at the picture, open-mouthed)
If I was you, I would try some other line of business--like mattress testing. 

JOE
Is this the Princess? 

HENNESSY
Yes, Mr. Bradley, 

(pointing to the picture)
that is the Princess. It isn't Annie Oakley, Dorothy Lamour, or Madame Chiang Kai-Shek. Take a good look at her 

(Joe closes his eyes in disbelief:)
you might be interviewing her again some day! 

JOE
(looking at Mr. Hennessy)
Am I fired? 

HENNESSY
No, you're not fired. When I wanna fire you you won't have to ask! 

(Joe looks back and forth and walks straight out of the office, carrying the paper)
--you'll know you're fired! 

(Joe walks to the other end of the newsroom, stopping. Shaking his head, seeing that Joe has left the office)
The man's mad. 
(Joe opens the other door, closing it carefully behind him and dials the wall-phone in the small foyer. Someone comes in from the front door and Joe watches him nervously until the man goes into the office.)

(An old man, Giovanni, sits down at the desk in his caretaker's room, picking up the phone. He greets Joe in Italian.)

JOE
Giovanni, it's Joe Bradley. Now, listen carefully: I want you to hurry up to my place and see if there's somebody there...asleep. 

GIOVANNI
(amused)
A-ha! Say, Mr. Joe: I look; 

(some Italian)
you wait. 

(Some Italian.)
(He walks to the door as Joe looks back and forth, impatiently. A few moments later Giovanni walks back to his desk, smiling. He sits down)
Mr. Joe? 

JOE
(almost shouting)
Yeah! 

(Repeating, quietly)
Er, yeah, yeah, yeah, tell me, tell me! 

GIOVANNI
Bellisimo. 

JOE
(he looks up, very relieved)
Giovanni: I love you. Now, listen... 

GIOVANNI
Yes, Mr. Joe. A gun? No! 

JOE
Yes, a gun, a knife--anything! But nobody goes in and nobody goes out! Capito? 

GIOVANNI
Ok. 

(He hangs up, getting up to obey Joe's instructions.)
(Joe Bradley, stealing another look at the paper, puts it in his pocket and walks back into the newsroom on his way to Mr. Hennessy's office. The secretary looks up, puzzled, and Joe gestures to her, reassuringly. He strides back into Mr. Hennessy's office.)

HENNESSY
You still here? 

JOE
(walking over he leans on the side of his desk)
How much would a real interview with this dame be worth? 

HENNESSY
Are you referring to Her Highness? 

JOE
I'm not referring to Annie (& HENNESSY repeating his words, overtaking him Oakley, Dorothy Lamour, or Madame....)--How much? 

HENNESSY
What do you care? you've got about as much chance of getting--. 

JOE
I know, but if I did, how much would it be worth? 

HENNESSY
Oh, just a plain talk about world conditions, it might be worth two hundred and fifty. Her views on clothes of course would be worth a lot more--maybe a thousand. 

JOE
Dollars? 

HENNESSY
Dollars. 

JOE
I'm talking about her views on everything: 

(dramatically, walking over to the front of Hennessy's desk)
'The Private and Secret Longings 

(pointing to the layout of an imagined heading in the air)
of a Princess'; her innermost thoughts as revealed to your own correspondent in a 

(leaning over Mr. Hennessy's desk, closer and closer)
private, personal, exclusive 

(in a loud whisper)
interview. 

(Hennessy looks at him open-mouthed, in a kind of daze)
Can't use it, huh? I didn't think you'd like it. 

(Joe walks to the door, opening it and slamming it shut, waking Mr. Hennessy from his daze.)

HENNESSY
(shaking his head, as if waking; firmly)
Come here! 

(Joe, satisfied, walks back over)
Love angle too, I suppose? 

JOE
Practically all love angle. 

HENNESSY
With pictures. 

JOE
(pausing, thinking)
Could be. How much? 

HENNESSY
That particular story would be worth five grand to any news service. But, er, tell me Mr. Bradley--if you are sober--just how are you going to obtain this fantastic interview? 

JOE
(confidentially)
I plan to enter her sick room disguised as a thermometer. You said five grand? I want you to 

(presents his hand)
shake on that. 

(Hennessy shakes his hand.)

HENNESSY
(as Joe rushes off to the door impatiently, stopping him)
Ah, you realise, of course, Her Highness is in bed today and leaves for Athens tomorrow. 

JOE
Yep.

PART 11

IRVING
(sitting down)
Hey, er, anybody tell you you're a dead ringer for--
(Joe kicks him in the shin under the table. In pain)
Oh! 

(Confidentially, Joe points a finger at Ann. Confused, Irving stands up)
Well er, I guess I'll be going. 

JOE
Oh, don't do a thing like that, Irving. Sit down; 

(pacifying him)
join us, join us, join us. 

IRVING
(not sure)
Well er, just till Fransesca gets here. 

ANN
Tell me, Mr. er, er, Radovich: er, what is a ringer? 

JOE
(IRVING to the waiter Oh, er, waiter.) It's an (IRVING Whiskey, please.) American term and er, (IRVING Yeah.) and it means er, anybody who has a great deal of charm. 

(Irving's look turns to puzzlement, responding with a questioning Hmm?.)

ANN
Oh. 

(Politely; interjecting before Irving can ask Joe what he's talking about)
Thank you. 

IRVING
You're welcome. 

(Irving is about to probe Joe again when two women walk past--one puts a hand on his shoulder and the other runs her hand through his hair as they walk past. They greet him with a "Ciao"..)

IRVING
(smiling back at them)
Er, ciao. 

ANN
Er, M--. 

IRVING
(to Ann)
Cousins. 

ANN
Mr. Bradley's just been telling me all about his work. 

IRVING
Mmm, I'd like to have heard that. 

ANN
What do you do? 

IRVING
I'm the same rank as 

(Joe starts coughing, holding his glass closer to Irving)
Joe only I'm a photo--
(Joe spills his glass over Irving. He stands up angry as Ann tries to dry him with a napkin.)

JOE
I'm awfully sorry, Irving! 

IRVING
(barely keeping his manners)
W-w-wha-? What are you--? 

JOE
I'm sorry, Irving. 

IRVING
(to Joe)
Look, I can take a hint! 

(Bowing, smiling, presenting his hand to Ann)
I'll see you around. 

ANN
Oh, but your drink's just here; please sit down. 

JOE
Yes, here's your drink right now, Irving; take it easy 

(Irving looks at Joe, unsure about trusting him.)
I'm sorry about that. Sit down, that's a good fellow 

(the waiter puts down Irving's drink and leaves)
(Something*). 

IRVING
(sitting down)
You're t--
(sitting down; stopping to wipe the chair dry)
You're twisting my arm, you know. 

JOE
(trying to communicate to Irving what can't say aloud)
Just- just be a little more careful not to spill... 

IRVING
Spill?! Who's been doin' the spilling? 

JOE
You. 

IRVING
Me?! 

JOE
(with a half-laugh)
Yeah. 

IRVING
(to Ann)
Where did you find this looney? 

(Smiling at her, remembering his manners, holding his glass up to toast)
You're ok; here's to you, huh? Here's hopin' for the best. 

(Pausing, looking between Ann and Joe)
If it, if it wasn't for that hair, I- I- I'd swear that--
(Joe kicks his chair back and Irving falls to the ground. Ann screams in shock. Two men help him up, muttering words in Italian.)

IRVING
(as they pull him up)
Thanks. 

JOE
(as him and Ann rush over to help)
You slipped, Irving. Slipped?--you almost hurt yourself that time! 

IRVING
(losing control)
I slipped?! (
JOE
Yes.), I almost hurt myself?! Joe, I didn't slip! 

JOE
(leading him away from Ann, pretending to examine his neck)
...got a bad sprain there. 

IRVING
(pushing his arms of him)
Never mind I got a bad sprain, Joe. 

JOE
(motioning to the cafe building)
You'd better go in here and get it fixed up. 

IRVING
(going with him willingly)
Well, yeah, I'd like to--. 

JOE
(back to Ann; walking to the door, his arm around Irving's shoulder as if he needs help)
Will you excuse us for a minute? 

ANN
(standing helpless)
Yes, of course; I- I'm so sorry. 
(Joe leads him to the back of the cafe, holding him around the shoulders, as Irving continues to argue.)

IRVING
Now wait, now wait; just a minute; let--; look, Joe, what are you tryin' to do? now take your hands off--! 

JOE
(reaching the back, in some privacy)
Have you got your letter? 

IRVING
What's that got to do with it? 

JOE
Have you got it? 

IRVING
Yeah! but what are you tryin' to do to me? 

JOE
(firmly, as Irving tries to pull his arm away)
Listen: what would you do for five grand? 

IRVING
(he ceases struggling)
Five grand? 

JOE
Yeah. 

(Pulling him down into a seat, reaching for a chair for himself, sitting down. Speaking in low tones)
Now, she doesn't know who I am or what I do. Look, Irving, this is my story; I dug it up, I gotta protect it! 

IRVING
She's really the--? 

JOE
(looking around anxiously)
Ssssh! 

(Quietly)
Your tin-types are gonna make this little epic twice as valuable. 

IRVING
(musing)
'The Princess Goes Slumming'. 

JOE
You're in for twenty-five percent of the take. 

IRVING
And it takes five G? 

JOE
Minimum--Henessey shook hands on it. 

IRVING
(counting in his head)
...seven, five; that's- that's fifteen hundred dollars! 

JOE
(sternly)
It's twelve-fifty. 

IRVING
Ok, now you shake. 

JOE
(shaking his hand as they stand up)
Ok, now, lend me thirty thousand. 

IRVING
Thirty th--? That's fifty bucks; you gonna buy the crown jewels? 

JOE
She's out there now drinking champagne that I can't pay for. We got to entertain her, don't we? 

IRVING
Joe: we can't go running around town with a... hot princess! 

JOE
Ssh, you want in on this deal or don't you? 

IRVING
(his gives him the money)
This I want back Saturday. 

JOE
Ok, now where's your lighter? 

(Irving pulls it out)
Let's go to work. 
(Irving and Joe file out of the cafe and back out to the table where Ann sits drinking her champagne, observing the waiter who clears the table.)

ANN
(hearing them come back out, exchanging smiles with Joe)
Better now? 

IRVING
Huh? 

ANN
(to Irving)
Your ear. 

IRVING
(as Joe sits; holding his ear)
My ear? Oh, yeah, er, Joe fixed it. 

(He sits; offering her a cigarette from a packet)
Er, would you care for a cigarette? 

ANN
Yes, please. 

(She takes one; smiling to Joe)
You won't believe this but it's my very first. 

JOE
(knowingly to Irving)
Your very first? 

ANN
Mm-hm. 

IRVING
(nodding to Joe)
Oh. 

JOE
No, er, smoking in school, hmm? 

IRVING
Your first cigarette.. 

(he flicks a switch on the lighter, turning a tiny wheel on the top. After a pause he switches the lighter on.)
There; gizmo works 

(he lights Ann's cigarette and she puffs.)

JOE
Well, what's the verdict, er... ok? 

ANN
(she takes the cigarette out; smiling)
Nothing to it. 

IRVING
(laughing)
That's right: nothing to it. 

JOE
(to the waiter at the next table)
Er, commerierie, 

(he says something in Italian to the waiter, taking out some money.)

IRVING
(moving his chair round slightly to be more in front of Ann)
Stretch my legs a little, here.

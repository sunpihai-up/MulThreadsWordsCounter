Part 15


JOE
Take it out of my salary, fifty bucks a week. 

HENNESSY
Don't think I won't! 

(He leaves.)

IRVING
Hey, what gives? Have we had a better offer? 

JOE
Irving... I, I don't know just how to tell you this, but--. 

IRVING
Wait till I sit down 

(he sits.)

JOE
Well, in regard to the story that goes with these: there is no story. 

IRVING
(pausing)
W-why not? 

JOE
(walking away to pour another drink)
I mean not as far as I'm concerned. 

IRVING
(he looks at Joe and, understanding, pauses for a moment)
Er, well, the er, pictures came out pretty well. You wanna have a look at 'em? 

(he goes to the bed, spreading the pictures out. He holds one up to Joe as he comes over)
Huh? 

(Enthusiastically; as Joe takes it, smiling)
How about a blow-up from a negative that size, huh? 

JOE
(laughing)
Yeah. 

(Joe picks some pictures up)
Ha, that's her first cigarette, huh? 

IRVING
Oh yeah, at Rocca's. 

(Joe displays the next one)
Hey, the Mouth of Truth. 

(looking at the next one they laugh. It's of Ann and Mario, dancing)
Oh, you wanna know the caption I had in mind, there? 'Barber cuts in'--huh? 

JOE
(taking another from the bed)
Well, here's the one I figured would be the key shot for the whole layout: 

(the picture is of Ann looking at the plaques)
'The Wall Where Wishes Come True', hmm? 

IRVING
Joe, that's good. Lead off with that then follow up on the wishes? 

JOE
Yeah. 

IRVING
(he picks up another one)
I dug that up out of a file: 'Princess Inspects Police'. 

JOE
Yeah, but--. 

IRVING
(handing him the next one, of Ann in custody after the scooter ride)
'Police Inspects Princess'. Huh? 

(They laugh)
How about that? 

JOE
Yeah. 

(Laughing)
Pretty good, pretty good. 

(Irving hands him the next one: of Ann smashing the Secret Service man over the head with the guitar)
(Wow!)

IRVING
Is that a shot? 

JOE
(What a picture!)

IRVING
Is that a shot, Joe? 'Body Guard Gets Body Blow'! 

JOE
Yeah. No, no, how 'bout this: 'Crowned Head'--huh? 

IRVING
Oh, I get it-- That-- Joe, you got--
(Joe face loses its humour and Irving's enthusiasm fades.)
She's fair game, Joe. It's always open season on princesses. 

(Shaking his shoulder)
You must be out of your mind! 

JOE
Yeah, I know but, er, look I can't prevent you from selling the pictures if you want to. You'll get a good price for 'em. 

IRVING
Yeah! 

(he bends over the bed to gather the pictures up.)

JOE
You going to the interview? 

IRVING
You goin'? 

JOE
Yeah. Well, it's an assignment, isn't it? 

IRVING
Yeah. 

(Irving closes the envelope, noticing his soaking pants. He lifts them off his wet leg, looking at Joe, annoyed. He goes out the door, talking back to Joe, disappointed)
I'll see you. 
(Joe stands and watches him leave.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(The huge Embassy hall. The floor teams with journalists and photographers, milling around. Joe and Irving enter, standing at the entrance.)

IRVING
(looking up at the incredible ornation in the building)
It ain't much, but it's home. 
(They walk into the crowd. A man approaches at the front of the room, on top of the landing and walks to right of the ornate chair sat in the centre. Several steps lead up to the landing from the floor and are carpeted down the centre. Standing motionless at the top of the steps the man claps twice, loudly.)

EMBASSY ANNOUNCER
Ladies and Gentlemen: please approach. 
(The crowd moves forward, pressing to the front behind the rope that marks the boundary. Joe and Irving move to the front, towards the right side of the gathering. The Master of Ceremonies approaches from the back also, walking to the other side of the first man, standing still. The Master of Ceremonies announces, in Italian, "Her Royal Highness", then again in English. He then stands sideways and waits.)
(In a moment, the Princess emerges accompanied by the Ambassador, the Countess, the General, and many others behind. Joe smiles slightly as she approaches. Princess Ann stands in front of the chair.)

AMBASSADOR
Your Royal Highness: the ladies and gentlemen of the Press 

(he motions with his hand.)
(Princess Ann turns to the gathering, raising and lowering her head in acknowledgement to them. As she looks over them her eyes fall on Joe and she starts just slightly, her expression hardening a little. She looks down as the Ambassador motions to the chair with his hand. She sits back gracefully, looking back up at Joe. They exchange looks. Ann turns her head, nodding to the Master of Ceremonies.)

MASTER OF CEREMONIES
(he bows, then turns to the group)
Ladies and Gentlemen: Her Royal Highness will now answer your questions. 

CHIEF OF CORRESPONDENTS
(standing in the crowd of journalists; speaking slowly, formally)
I believe at the outset, Your Highness, that I should express the pleasure of all of us at your recovery from the recent illness. 

ANN
Thank you. 

AMERICAN CORRESPONDENT
(speaking from the crowd)
Does Your Highness believe that Federation would be a possible solution to Europe's economic problems? 

ANN
I am in favour of any measure which would lead to closer cooperation in Europe. 

CORRESPONDENT
And what, in the opinion of Your Highness, is the outlook for Friendship Among Nations? 

ANN
I have every faith in it--
(pausing; turning to look at Joe)
as I have faith in relations between people 

(the people on the stage around her look about, slightly baffled; the press gathering stirs slightly.)

JOE
May I say (speaking from my own press service) we believe that Your Highness's faith will not be unjustified. 

ANN
(looking at Joe; smiling very slightly to him)
I am so glad to hear you say it. 

CORRESPONDENT
Which of the cities visited did Your Highness enjoy the most? 
(Ann pauses as she looks at Joe.)

GENERAL
(quietly, prompting her)
Each in its own way... 

ANN
Each in its own way was...unforgettable. It would be difficult to--
(she stops, then her face softens.)
Rome; by all means, Rome. 

(The press stirs, muttering to themselves quietly. She turns to look at Joe)
I will cherish my visit here, in memory, as long as I live. 

CORRESPONDENT
Despite your indisposition, Your Highness? 

ANN
(turning to the correspondent)
Despite that. 

MASTER OF CEREMONIES
Photographs may now be taken. 
(The photographers swarm out from both sides from under the rope, jostling before the steps as they photograph her. Princess Ann stands up for them, stepping forward.)
(As the photographers finish, Irving steps up, smiling to Ann as he holds his small cigaretter lighter camera. He bends forward, looking into it, as Ann smiles at him from above. Her expression turns to astonishment when she realises what is it that he is using as a camera. Irving smiles at her and Ann looks over at Joe who also smiles back. The last of the photographers retreats behind the rope. Irving rejoins Joe behind the rope.)

GENERAL
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much. 

ANN
(to the Ambassador, who is slightly taken aback)
I would now like to meet some of the ladies and gentlemen of the Press. 
(Ann walks down the steps, stopping as the Countess and the General walk down to accompany her. When they stop, she continues, walking down the steps and to the left of the gathering, smiling as she walks to up to the journalists.)

IRVING
(reaching into his pocket, then giving her the envelope)
Er, may I present Your Highness with some commemorative photos of your visit to Rome? 

ANN
(she takes the envelope, opening it, and removing one of the photos slightly to see. It is the one of her hitting the man with the guitar. She suppresses her amusement)
Thank you so very much 

(she pauses slightly before she turns look at Joe.)

JOE
(as she walks across to him)

Good afternoon. 

CORRESPONDENT
*, * Press 

(he shakes her hand.)
(Reaching the last of the front-row journalists, Ann turns and walks slowly up the steps. The press gathering applauds her warmly as she reaches the top, her back to them. Slowly, she turns to face them, smiling broadly to the the gathering as she looks over them. Inevitably, her eyes fall to Joe. He smiles back, then her expression grows sorrowful. She manages another slight smile then turns away from them, and walks slowly and gracefully towards the exit. The officials step aside for her to pass and then file after her through the door.)
(As she leaves, Joe watches her solemnly, the press turning to leave also. Before turning to go himself, Irving looks to Joe, but seeing his gaze unmoved walks away with the rest of them.)
(The press, bustling and chattering behind him leave Joe alone, standing at the rope, looking at the empty spot where the Princess was last.)
(Finally, Joe turns slowly to leave as the crowd disappears out of the entrance to the building. Alone but for the guards lining the room he walks slowly to the exit; hands in pockets, leaving the stage behind him; the huge room silent except for his slow footsteps.)
(Stopping near the entrance, he pauses for a moment to look down the long hall back at the empty stage. Then, he turns and walks away.)

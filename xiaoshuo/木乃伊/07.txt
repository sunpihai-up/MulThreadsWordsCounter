PART 7

EXT. CAMP - LATER THAT NIGHT
Having just freshened up for bed, Evelyn exits the temple and
steps past the sleeping Diggers. She spots the Egyptologist,
his jeweled canopic jar snug under one arm, the Book Of The
Dead laying loose under the other. Evelyn stares at the Book,
nervously biting her lip, then she sneaks over, carefully
steals it, and quickly tip-toes away.
Lying on some blankets by the campfire, O'Connell rolls over
and sees Evelyn, sitting wide-eyed, staring at the Book.
O'CONNELL
You sure you outta be playin,
around with that?
EVELYN
It's just a book, no harm ever
came from a book.
Evelyn opens the cover. THE FIRE FLICKERS. She and O'Connell
share a nervous look, then Evelyn shrugs and starts reading.
EVELYN
Ahm kum Ra. Ahm kum Dei.
Evelyn continues READING THE BOOK ALOUD IN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.
INT. IMHOTEPIS CHAMBER - NIGHT
Evelyn's VOICE is OVERLAID as WE START WIDE on Imhotep's
chamber and SLOWLY PUSH IN on his sarcophagus. WE PUSH IN
over the lip of the coffin, then closer and closer towards
Imhotep's rotten, twisted head, until his putrid face fills
FRAME, --and then suddenly his crusty eyelids Pop OPEN!
Revealing EMPTY SOCKETS. --BIG SCARY MUSIC STING.
EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT
The Egyptologist sits bolt upright. Quickly looks around,
sees Evelyn reading the Book. He gets up and runs for her.
EGYTOLOGIST
NO! NOOOO! YOU MUST NOT!
He skids to a stop as a strange, piercing WHINE is heard,
coming from out in the desert. O'Connell and the others all
leap to their feet. The Americans run out of their tents.
The SOUND gets LOUDER and CLOSER. And then from out of the
darkness a HUGE WALL OF LOCUSTS SWIRLS into camp and envelops
everyone. O'Connell grabs Evelyn, and with Jonathan at their
side they race for the crevice, trying to fend off the horrid
vermin as they go. Beni and the Americans run for the temple.
The Egyptologist is covered in locusts. He stares at The Book
Of The Dead, looking haunted.
EGYPTOLOGIST
What have we done?
The campfire is SUCKED UP INTO THE AIR
INT. LABYRINTH CORRIDOR - NIGHT
O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race down the labyrinth,
slapping at themselves and picking locusts out of their hair
JONATHAN
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers!
Billions of grasshoppers!
O'CONNELL
That's one of the plagues, right?
The grasshopper plague!
EVELYN
This is not a plague. It's
generational. Every so many
years the locusts of Egypt
have a population explosion
and they all take flight.
Evelyn steps forward, something SQUISHES. O'Connell lowers
his TORCH, --the entire floor is FILLED WITH SLIMY FROGS.
O'CONNELL
Okay, ....and what about frogs?
INT. LABYRINTH PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
The Americans, Beni and the Diggers race into a passageway.
Burns is knocked down, his bifocals skitter across the
ground, they get CRUSHED in the stampede. Burns staggers to
his feet, squinting. BLURRY FIGURES vanish into the darkness,
BURNS
Daniels! Henderson!
INT. LABYRINTH CORRIDOR - NIGHT
The ground under O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan starts to
SHAKE. Then suddenly, right in front of them, --HUNDREDS OF
CHITTERING SCARAB-BEETLES BOIL UP OUT OF THE SAND. Start
scurrying towards them. Evelyn SCREAMS. Jonathan SCREAMS.
Even O'Connell almost screams. They turn around and haul-ass.

INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
Burns staggers down a passageway, squinting, his hands out in
front of him, groping, trying not to bump into anything. Then
ten feet in front of him, a dark, blurry FIGURE steps out.
BURNS
Daniels? .... is that you?
Burns half-blindly staggers forward. The Figure doesn't move.
BURNS
Henderson?
Burns TRIPS, stumbles forward, towards the Figure, his hands
reach out and SINK INTO IMHOTEPIS PUTRID CHEST CAVITY. Burns
jumps like a scalded cat, pulls his hands out and looks at
them, --HIS HANDS ARE COVERED IN MOLTEN FLESH ROT. He starts
to SCREAM. A SKELETAL HAND clamps over his mouth.
LABYRINTH STAIRCASE - NIGHT
O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race up the staircase,
just ahead of the mass of SCURRYING, CHITTERING SCARABS.
O'Connell leaps out onto a pedestal. Jonathan jumps up next
to him. Evelyn jumps up into a grotto on the other side of
the narrow stairway. The horrible herd of vicious scarabs
scurries between them, their ear-piercing CRITTERS send
shivers up Evelyn's spine. She leans back. THE WALL MOVES.
Evelyn falls backwards through an opening. O'Connell and
Jonathan watch the scarabs vanish up the staircase. Then
they look across the way. Evelyn is gone.
JONATHAN
EVY!?
SCARAB CHAMBER - NIGHT
Evelyn sits up, shakes the sand out of her hair, fearfully
looks around. It's almost PITCH BLACK. She gets up and feels
her way along the dark walls. She rounds a corner. A shaft of
MOONLIGHT filters in through a crack in the ceiling. A MAN
stands in the middle of the room. Evelyn walks towards him.
EVELYN
Oh thank goodness, you're one
of the Americans, aren't you?
Just as she reaches him he turns around. It's Burns. BOTH OF
HIS EYES ARE MISSING. He stares at her with vacant sockets.
Evelyn SCREAMS in horror and backs away, hyperventilating,
she bumps into something. She SCREAMS again and spins around
It's Imhotep. With two fresh EYEBALLS in his sockets.

Evelyn SCREAMS again and backs away into a wall. Her hair is
down, her face is dirty and sweaty, her blouse is ripped, her
dress is torn, she's never looked sexier. Imhotep SQUINTS.
IMHOTEP
Anck-su-namun?
LABYRINTH STAIRCASE - NIGHT
O'Connell is feeling his way around inside the grotto
O'CONNELL
Damn-it! Must be a trap door
around here or somethin'.
And then they heat MEN SCREAMING, and suddenly, Henderson,
Daniels and one of the Diggers come running down the stairs.
HENDERSON
RUN, YOU SONS-A-BITCHES! RUUUUN!
O'Connell and Jonathan join them as they hear the herd of
CHITTERING scarabs coming their way. The Digger suddenly
trips and falls. O'Connell slows down, about to go back and
help him. But it's too late. The Digger SCREAMS in horror as
the herd of scarabs run over him, eating straight through
him, leaving behind the Digger's half eaten skeleton. Daniels
Henderson and Jonathan react in horror. O'Connell's already
running, races right past them. The others turn and haul-ass.
SCARAB CHAMBER - NIGHT
Imhotep steps forward, --the sand around him seems to
MAGNETIZE, swirling and dancing around his flaking skeletal
legs. Evelyn starts backing away, horrified, looks at Burns
EVELYN
Help me, ...please, ...help me.
Burns opens his mouth, but can only GURGLE and MOAN because
HIS TONGUE IS MISSING. Imhotep grabs him, throws him to the
ground and sets his skeletal foot on Burns' chest, like a big
game hunter standing on his kill. Imhotep then parts his
fetid lips, --A FRESH TONGUE FLAPS BETWEEN HIS ROTTED TEETH.
IMHOTEP
Kadeesh pharos Anck-su-namun!
Evelyn shivers in fear. Suddenly, O'Connell comes flying
around the corner and runs right up to her.
O'CONNELL
Would you quit playin, around!
Let's get outta here already!
O'Connell sees the look in her eyes and turns around, --at
the sight of Imhotep, O'Connell jumps back in fright.
O'CONNELL
WHOA!
O'Connell and Evelyn start backing away down the wall.
Imhotep glides sideways with them, like a tiger cornering his
prey, the sand around him SWIRLS and DANCES. Burns starts to
crawl away, whimpering as he goes. Imhotep suddenly stops and
UNHINGES his skeletal jaw, his skinless mouth stretches to an
inhuman size, and he lets out a horrific, primordial SHRIEK.
IMHOTEP
ANCK-SU-NAMUUUUUN!!!!
Evelyn SCREAMS. O'Connell shudders, then, embarrassed by his
fear, he opens his own mouth and ROARS right back at him--
O'CONNELL
Ahhhhhhhh!!
Then BLASTS him with the elephant gun, --BLAM! Through the
SMOKE AND FLAMMAGE we see Imhotep blown off his feet, his
ribcage half torn away. O'Connell grabs Evelyn and runs.
EXT. CREVICE - NIGHT
SAND and WIND whip through the ruins as O'Connell and Evelyn
stumble up out of the crevice and COME FACE-TO-FACE WITH TEN
ARMED MUMIA. The Mumia quickly raise their guns. O'Connell
and Evelyn quickly raise their hands. Jonathan, Henderson,
Daniels and the Egyptologist are already on their knees,
hands over their heads. Ardeth Bay steps forward.
ARDETH BAY
I told you to leave or die, you
refused, and now you may have killed
us all. For you have unleashed the
creature that we have feared for
more than four thousand years.
O'CONNELL
Relax, I got him.
ARDETH BAY
No mortal weapons can kill this
creature. He is not of this world.
O'CONNELL
Are we talkin, about the same
creature? The walking corpse?
Really big mouth? Really bad breath?
INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - NIGHT
Beni sloway backs up around Anubis, eyes wide, gun up. He
turns around, --IMHOTEP IS RIGHT THERE! Beni SCREAMS, backs
away and OPENS FIRE. Six GUNSHOTS perforate Imhotep, but have
no effect except to SPLATTER molten flesh rot onto the back
wall. Beni retreats into a corner, scared shitless. Imhotep
moves forward, his one hand trying to stop the molten mummy
guts from oozing out of the large shotgun hole in his side.
Beni drops his gun and grabs at the CHAINS around his neck,
'RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS AND ICONS dangle from each chain. Beni
holds the first one up: A CHRISTIAN CRUCIFIX. He quickly
makes the sign of-the cross and blesses himself in English:
BENI
May the good Lord protect and watch
over me as a shepherd watches over
his flock. And may Satan in all his
forms be vanquished forever.
It has no effect on Imhotep, who continues forward. Beni
quickly grabs at the other symbols and icons, holding them
out towards Imhotep, one after the other, trying to slow his
progress: an Islamic Sword and Crescent Moon necklace; a
Hindu Brahma medallion; a small Buddhist Bodhisattva statue.
All while blessing himself in Arabic, Hindi, Chinese and
Latin. Nothing works. Imhotep's skeletal hand reaches for
Beni's throat. Tears run down Beni's cheeks he's so freaked.
And that's when he holds up THE STAR OF DAVID and blesses
himself in HEBREW. Imhotep stops in his tracks. His hand
lowers. His grotesque new eyeballs stare at Beni.
IMHOTEP (subtitled)

The language of the slaves.

Looks at him quizzically. Imhotep takes a step back.
IMHOTEP (in Hebrew - subtitled)
I may have use for you. And
the rewards will be great.
Imhotep reaches into his tattered robe, and then holds out
his fetid hand, filled with squirming MAGGOTS. Beni cringes,
about to throw up, but then the maggots part, --revealing a
tiny pile of little JEWELS. Beni's eyes widen. Imhotep raises
his other hand, it holds Anck-su-namun's BROKEN CANOPIC JAR.
IMHOTEP (subtitled)
Where are the other sacred jars?
EXT . CREVICE - NIGHT
Several Mumia drag Burns up, he stares out with vacant
sockets. Daniels and Henderson are especially horrified.
DANIELS
You bastards!
HENDERSON
What did you do to him!?
ARDETH BAY
We saved him! Saved him before
the creature could finish his work
Now leave, all of you, quickly,
before he finishes you all.
JONATHAN
You're not going to kill us?
Evelyn ELBOWS Jonathan in the ribs.
ARDETH BAY
We must now hunt him down, and
try and find a way to kill him,
before he consumes the earth.
Allah be with us.
Ardeth Bay and the Mumia start heading down into the crevice.
O'Connell yells at them, trying to convince himself-
O'CONNELL
I told ya, I already got him!
Ardeth Bay stops and looks back, deadly serious.
ARDETH BAY
Know this, the creature will be
coming for you. He must consummate
the curse. And until he does, he
will never eat, he will never sleep,
and he will never stop.
Ardeth Bay turns and jumps down into the crevice,

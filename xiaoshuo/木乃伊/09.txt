PART 9

INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - DAY
O'Connell, Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels follow Evelyn
across the Ramesseum.
EVELYN
There's only one person I know
who can possibly give us some
answers.
They round a corner and come upon the Curator, --who is
talking with Ardeth Bay. Everybody stops.
EVERYBODY
YOU!
O'Connell and the American's quickly draw their guns.
Ardeth Bay just scowls. The Curator nods his head.
CURATOR
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
EVELYN
What is he doing here?
CURATOR
Do you truly wish to know? or
would you prefer to just shoot us?
Everybody tenses, guns up. Then O'Connell uncocks his .38.
O'CONNELL
I just saw my fist vanish into
some guy's head.
He slides his gun back into his shoulder-holster.
O'CONNELL
I'm willin, to go on a little
faith, here.
CURATOR
You will not believe it
O'CONNELL
Try me.

INT. RAMESSEUM - MOMENTS LATER
Everyone is assembled around the tomb display of Seti The
First. We recognize his chariot and sword. The Curator sits
on Seti's throne.
CURATOR
We are part of an ancient secret
society, the cult-of-the-Mumia,
and we have a sacred mission,
passed down through thirty-nine
generations. For over four thousand
years we have guarded The City Of
The Dead. we are sworn at manhood
to , do any and all in our power to
stop the High Priest Imhotep from
being reborn into this world.
ARDETH RAY
And because of you, we have failed.
EVELYN (appalled)
And you think this justifies
killing innocent people!?
CURATOR
To have stopped this creature? Yes!
O'CONNELL
Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's
afraid of cats, what's that about?
CURATOR
According to the ancients, cat's
are the guardians at the gates of
the underworld. Imhotep will fear
them until he is fully regenerated,
and then he will fear nothing.
Daniels is totally wigged-out, he looks at O'Connell.
DANIELS
Right! And ya know how he gets
fully regenerated?! By killing
everybody who opened that chest
and sucking us dry! That's how!
CURATOR
Yes, the creature must first try
and regenerate, and then he will
attempt to resurrect the one he
has loved for more than four
thousand years.
EVELYN
Anck-su-namun.
The Curator and Ardeth Bay look at Evelyn, thunderstruck.
EVELYN
In the necropolis, when I saw him,
alive, ...walking, he called me
Anck-su-namun. And then in Mister
Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
CURATOR
It is because it was you who read
from the Book. He has chosen you to
be-the human sacrifice needed to
regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
Jonathan scratches his ear with the barrel of his pistol.
JONATHAN
This is not good. Not good at all
Ardeth Bay has been staring out a wall of windows.
ARDETH BAY
Tonight is the full moon. The moon
of Osiris. It will begin tonight.
Everyone follows Ardeth Bay's eyes, through the windows we
can see the SUN, --which is now going into a FULL ECLIPSE.
JONATHAN
"...and he stretched forth his
hands towards the heavens, and
there was darkness throughout
the land of Egypt."
EXT. BRITISH FORT - WINDOW - DAY FOR NIGHT
O'Connell looks out a window at the British Soldiers manning
the walls. Above and beyond them, --is the BLACK SUN.
EXT. EVELYN'S FOYER - DAY FOR NIGHT
Evelyn and Jonathan are pacing the foyer
EVELYN
we must stop him from regenerating.
She turns to Daniels and Henderson
EVELYN
Who opened that chest?
HENDERSON
Well, there was me and Daniels here
and then poor Burns of course, oh
yeah, and that Egyptologist fella.
O'Connell turns from the window
O'CONNELL
What about my buddy, Beni?
DANIELS
Naw, he scrammed outta there,
EVELYN
We must find the Egyptologist
and bring him back here to the
safety of the fort, before the
creature can get to him.
O'Connell looks at Evelyn, Daniels and Henderson.
O'CONNELL
Okay, ...Evelyn, you wait here,
you two come with me.
All three of them pounce on him at once--
HENDERSON
The hell with that! I'm not
goin' nowhere! we're safe here.
DANIELS
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this
fort for nothin'.
EVELYN
Who put you in charge? You can't
just leave me behind like some old
suitcase. I'm the one responsible
for this mess and I intend to be
the one to clean it up.
O'Connell just shakes his head and SIGHS. Totally put-upon.
Then he takes Evelyn, shoves her into the bedroom, slams the
door and locks it with a skeleton key. From inside her room
we can hear Evelyn POUNDING on the door and YELLING.
O'Connell throws the skeleton key to Daniels.
O'CONNELL
Keep an eye on her. If you leave
her door, I'll rip your spleen out
C'mon, Jonathan.
Jonathan swallows hard and points to himself
JONATHAN
Me?
CAIRO ALLEYWAYS - BAZAAR - DAY FOR NIGHT
The Egyptologist stumbles through the dark alleys, looking
haunted. He clutches the Book of The Dead in one hand and his
SACRED CANOPIC JAR in the other. Imhotep is stalking him. A
STREET VENDOR turns and sees Imhotep's horribly decayed face.
He reacts and scurries away. Imhotep lifts his robe, covers
his face, and moves in on the Egyptologist, who is heading
into the bazaar. WE PAN UP TO--
THE EGYPTOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT
Beni is RANSACKING the joint, pulling out drawers and files
and throwing them on the floor. He finds a silver pocket
watch, shakes it, then throws it into his pocket, then he
starts tipping over bookcases and clearing shelves.
O'CONNELL(o.s.)
well, well, well.
Beni spins around. O'Connell and Jonathan stand in the door.
O'CONNELL
Lemme guess, spring cleaning?
Beni turns and runs for an open window. O'Connell grabs a
chair, FLINGS IT into his path. Beni TRIPS and CRASHES into a
wall. O'Connell strides over, grabs him and lifts him up the
wall. Beni's feet dangle off the floor.
O'CONNELL
Where's your new friend?
BENI
what friend? You're my only friend
O'Connell quickly slides his knife up under Beni's chin
O'CONNELL
Then you got no excuse for living.
What the hell you doin, being
buddies with this creep, Beni?
What's in it for you?
BENI
It is better to be the right hand
of the Devil,....than in his path.
As long as I serve him, I am immune.

O'CONNELL
Immune from what?
BENI
You shall see.

O'CONNELL
What are you looking for?
Lie, and I'll slit your throat
O'Connell shoves the knife deeper into Beni's skin.
BENI
The book! The black book they
found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep
wants it back. Said to me it
would be worth it's weight
in diamonds.
O'CONNELL
What does he want the book for?
BENI (shrugs)
Something about bringing his
dead girly-friend back to life
He needs the book....
(looks at Jonathan)
And your sister.
O'Connell looks at Jonathan. Beni seizes the moment and KNEES
O'Connell in the balls. O'Connell doubles over and collapses.
Beni leaps out the window. Jonathan cringes.
JONATHAN
That looked rather painful
O'CONNELL (wincing)
Ya know, ever since I met you,
my luck has been for crap.
JONATHAN
Yes, I know, I do that to people
And that's when they hear a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM coming from
down in the bazaar. O'Connell and Jonathan scramble to the
window and look out--
EXT. BAZAAR - DAY FOR NIGHT
Down in the bazaar, people are SCREAMING and quickly backing
away from the SHRIVELLED CORPSE OF THE EGYPTOLOGIST.
A partially decayed HAND reaches down and takes the sacred
canopic jar out of the Egyptologist's shriveled hand. It's
Imhotep, having regenerated even further. He looks up and
catches eyes with O'Connell. Imhotep grins, then UNHINGES; his
jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman size, and then a huge
SWARM OF FLIES comes out of his mouth and races straight up
at O'Connell and Jonathan. They both SLAM the shutters.
The flies SLAM into the closed window and immediately spread
throughout the bazaar. Sending people SCREAMING and running.
EGYPTOLOGISTS OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT
O'Connell and Jonathan look at each other, panicked
O'CONNELL
Damn-it! That's two down and
only two to go.
JONATHAN
And then he'll be coming after Evy.
They turn and race out of the office.
BRITISH FORT - WINDOW --NIGHT
Daniels stares out a window, watching the British Guards at
the front gate. more Soldiers march the encircling parapet.
SOLDIER
Ten O'clock! All is well!
The lights and MUSIC from the Casbah come up from below
INT. EVELYN'S FOYER - NIGHT
Daniels turns from the window. Henderson sits in a chair next
to Evelyn's door, chain smoking. Both look wired with fear.
DANIELS
The hell with this. I'm goin,
downstairs to get me a drink.
You want somethin,?
HENDERSON
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a
shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser
Daniels nods and heads out. Henderson just sits there, alone,
smoking. He reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out his
SACRED CANOPIC JAR and fondles it. A BREEZE suddenly comes in
through the open window. The curtains flutter. Henderson gets
up and goes over to shut it. He looks out the window.
The CAMERA races over the compound, into the window and HITS
Henderson square in the FACE just as he's about to scream.
Henderson is lifted into the air by a mass of SWIRLING SAND.
His body TWISTS and TURNS and Slowly SHRIVELS as the life is
SUCKED out of him. Then he COLLAPSES to the floor. On the
wall above him, the SHADOW of the SWIRLING SAND condenses,
forming a SHADOW of a human body. The SHADOW CONVULSES as the
body REGENERATES. And then it's over.
Imhotep steps into view. He's regenerated even further and
looks almost normal now, his face no longer decayed. He steps
over Henderson's shriveled body and up to Evelyn's door,
rattles the knob. it's locked. Imhotep grins.
EVELYN'S ROOM - NIGHT
Evelyn is asleep in her bed as SAND begins streaming in through
the keyhole, pouring onto the floor, forming a large mound. Evelyn
starts to toss and turn. WE PAN BACK OVER TO THE DOOR: The mound
of sand is gone and in it's place is Imhotep.

PART 5

INT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY
The Warden crawls into a DARK CHAMBER and LIGHTS A TORCH.
A mural wall comes alive. Embedded into it are dozens of
black amethyst SCARABS; glittering images of the sacred
beetles. Awestruck, the Warden pulls out a pocket knife and
starts prying away at one of the precious bugs.
INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY
Beni and the Americans hover around the Egyptologist, who's
found the SECRET COMPARTMENT inside Anubis. The Egyptologist
brushes sand away from the seam . Henderson steps forward and
grabs the seam, --the Egyptologist quickly stops him.
EGYPTOLOGIST
Seti was no fool.
Henderson sees the intense look in the Egyptologist's eyes
HENDERSON
Yeah, sure....
He looks back at the native Diggers.
HENDERSON
We'll let him open it.
The Egyptologist nods, then YELLS IN EGYPTIAN at the Diggers.
The Diggers hesitate, filled with fear. Daniels pulls out his gun,
aims it at three of the Diggers. The three Diggers hesitantly step
forward with crowbars and stick them into the seams. The other
Diggers back away, scared shitless. Beni and the Americans
exchange looks, and then they back away as well.
INT. IMHOTEPIS CHAMBER - DAY
Three Heroes are still digging into the ceiling
O'CONNELL
Lemme get this straight, they
stuck a sharp, red hot poker up
your nose, cut your brain into
small pieces, then ripped it
all out through your nostrils?
JONATHAN
OWCH! That's really got to hurt.
EVELYN
It's called mummification.
You're dead when they do this

JONATHAN
still....
O'CONNELL
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
EVELYN
You two are worse than a couple
of schoolboys.
And that's when a huge chunk of the roof suddenly GIVES OUT.
O'Connell GRABS Evelyn and JERKS her clear. Jonathan DIVES
for the far wall. A MASSIVE STONE CASEMENT DROPS OUT OF THE
CEILING AND CRASHES to the floor. DUST FLIES. Fills the room.
INT. ANLIBIS CHAMBER -
Having heard the crash, Beni and the Americans have their
guns pointed at the floor. The Egyptologist could care less,
he looks at the Diggers, gripping their crowbars, and YELLS--
EGYPTOLOGIST
FENI!
The three Diggers PULL HARD. The ancient seams start to give,
The Egyptologist YELLS again. The Diggers PULL HARDER. The
compartment starts to loosen. Again he YELLS. The Diggers
give one final pull and--
--AN INTENSE BURST OF LIQUID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM. HITS THE
THREE DIGGERS. MELTS THEIR SKIN CLEAN OFF. They SCREAM. Dying
horribly. HALF SKELETAL by the time they hit the ground ......
INT. IMHOTEPIS CHAMBER - DAY
The dust is starting to clear. O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan
slowly get up and step over to the massive stone casement.
We immediately recognize it as IMHOTEPIS SARCOPHAGUS.
EVELYN
Oh my god, ...it looks like,
it looks like a sarcophagus.
O'CONNELL
Why would they bury somebody
in the ceiling?
EVELYN
They didn't, they buried him
at the foot of Anubis. He was
either someone of great importance.
or he did something very naughty.
INT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY
The warden drops an amethyst-scarab into his pouch, then
greedily-starts prying away at another. It rips off, he drops
it into his pouch, --only he misses, and this scarab quietly
falls to the sandy floor without the Warden noticing.
CLOSE ON: the scarab on the floor. It begins to TRANSFORM.
The amethyst starts to glow. Something inside starts to
WIGGLE; as if the amethyst were some sort of strange cocoon.
Then it splits open and a real live hideous SCARAB--BEETLE
scurries out. It races over to the warden's shoe, quickly
burrows into the leather and vanishes inside.
The Warden's eyes FLY OPEN. He starts to SCREAM, drops his
knife and frantically starts clawing away at his pant leg,
higher and higher until he rips open his shirt revealing a
large, hideous LUMP, BURROWING UNDER HIS SKIN. IT BURROWS
IT'S WAY UP HIS FAT BELLY AND ACROSS HIS HAIRY CHEST. The
Warden claws and scratches at it, trying to stop it. The lump
BURROWS UP HIS NECK. The Warden starts GAGGING and COUGHING.
And then the scarab-lump VANISHES INTO HIS HEAD.
INT. IMHOTEPIS CHAMBER - DAY
Our Heroes clear the dirt off the top of the sarcophagus,
revealing a single, ominous hieroglyph. Evelyn stares at it
Jonathan impatiently strums his fingers across the lid.
JONATHAN
Well? .... Who is it?
Evelyn stares at the hieroglyph, confused and concerned.
EVELYN
'He that shall not be named.
O'Connell dusts off the huge LOCK
O'CONNELL
There's some sort of lock here.
You say these thing's are made
of granite with a steel interior?
EVELYN
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
JONATHAN
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't
getting out.
O'CONNELL
No kiddin', without a key, it'll
take us a month to crack this thing,
EVELYN
A key! That's it! That's what he
was talking about.
O'CONNELL
Who was talking about what?
Evelyn starts rummaging through the pack on Jonathan's back.
EVELYN
The man on the barge. The one
with the hook, he was looking
for a key.
Evelyn pulls out the key/box. Jonathan tries to take it back,
JONATHAN
Hey that's mine!
Evelyn slaps his hand and quickly unfolds the box, --it's now
shaped exactly like the LOCK'S KEYHOLE. Evelyn smiles. And
that's when they hear the Warden's SCREAMS echoing through
the labyrinth. All three of them turn and take-off running.
INT. LABYRINTH - DAY
The Warden is SCREAMING and dancing insanely around the
labyrinth, totally freaked from the extreme pain in his head.
O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan run up just as the Warden
starts RIPPING his own hair out of his head. O'Connell and
Jonathan grab at the Warden's hands, but he's far too crazed,
he shoves them aside, runs full bore down the length of the
labyrinth and SLAMS his head straight into a rock wall. The
Warden drops to the ground. Dead as lead. Eyes wide open.
O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan just stand there staring,
breathing hard, wide-eyed themselves ..............
EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT
Evelyn and Jonathan are nuzzled up to a campfire.
EVELYN
What do you suppose killed him?
JONATHAN
Did you ever see him eat?
O'Connell comes up over some rocks.
O'CONNELL
Seems the Americans had a little
misadventure of their own today,
three of their diggers were killed.
EVELYN
How?
O'CONNELL
Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid.
Some sort of ancient booby-trap.
JONATHAN
Maybe this place really is cursed
A GUST OF WIND blows through the camp. The campfire FLICKERS
O'Connell and Jonathan share a nervous look. Evelyn laughs.
EVELYN
two!
O'CONNELL
don't believe in curses, huh?
EVELYN
No. I believe if I can see it
and I can touch it, then it's
real. That's what I believe.
O'Connell cocks his rifle, KA-CHANK! Gives her a big grin.
O'CONNELL
I believe in being prepared.
Jonathan opens the Warden's POUCH, the one that held the
scarabs. He reaches in, starts scrounging around. WE SLOWLY
PUSH IN. Waiting for the attack. THE MUSIC BUILDS. And then,
--Jonathan SCREAMS in pain and RIPS his hand back out of the
pouch. O'Connell and Evelyn both jump.
O'CONNELL/EVELYN
WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?!
Jonathan sucks his finger, then reaches back into the pouch
and pulls out a LIQUOR BOTTLE, the top has been chipped off.
JONATHAN
Seagrams!
Jonathan smiles at the bottle, then turns the pouch inside-
out and shakes it, nothing but SAND is inside it.
JONATHAN
Well, he may have been a stinky
fellow,....but he had good taste
Jonathan takes a swig. O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, guiltily
And then O'Connell suddenly kneels down and sticks his ear to
the sand. Evelyn and Jonathan watch him. A BEAT. And then a
BARAGE OF GUNFIRE IS HEARD coming from the American camp.
O'Connell jumps up and throws the elephant gun to Evelyn.
O'CONNELL
Stay here!
He takes off running through the ruins. Evelyn immediately
gets up and runs after him. Jonathan grabs a gun, holds the
bottle of Seagrams; tight and dashes after her.
JONATHAN
Evy! Excuse me! But didn't
the man just say--!
EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - NIGHT
The American camp is under siege. Two dozen MUMIA RIDERS
gallop through. FIRING RIFLES. Several Diggers are killed as
they run. The Americans leap out of their tents FIRING. Kill
multiple Riders. Daniels is shot, spins and falls, keeps
SHOOTING. Henderson and Burns run to his aid, BLASTING AWAY.
O'Connell races through the ruins and SLAMS right into Beni,
who is obviously trying to high-tail-it out of there.
O'CONNELL
Goin' somewhere?
BENI
Just looking for you, O'Connell!
I wanted to be with my friend!
O'Connell drags him back towards the American camp.
O'CONNELL
C'mon, friend.
BENI
(struggling)
Why do you like to fight so much?
O'CONNELL
'Cause I look good doin, it.
Ardeth Bay gallops through the camp, cutting Diggers down
with his scimitar. O'Connell runs up on top of some rocks,
LEAPS OUT and TACKLES him off his horse. The two men SLAM to
the ground. O'Connell spins up onto one knee and FIRES, point
blank. Blows the scimitar out of Ardeth Bay's hand. O'Connell
is about to shoot again when a horse rides up between them.

A scimitar swoops down, almost takes O'Connell's head off,
misses him by an inch. O'Connell leaps up and blows the Rider
off his mount. The horse BOLTS. --But Ardeth Bay is gone.
Evelyn hides behind some rocks, watching the scene, suddenly,
she hears something coming up behind her and spins around.
A vicious tattooed Mumia Rider races at her. Evelyn quickly
backpedals over the rocks, terrified. The Mumia Rider raises
his scimitar, about to strike. Evelyn SCREAMS, trips over a
rock and FIRES the elephant gun, --BLAM! Blows the Rider off
his mount and CATAPULTS him twenty feet back into some ruins.
At the same time, the kick blows Evelyn off her feet and over
a ridge. She FLAILS through the air and lands in a sand dune.
Jonathan and some - Diggers are holding their own near the
temple door. Four Riders come CHARGING right at them.
Jonathan takes a swig off the Seagrams.
JONATHAN
Let 'em have it, boys!
Jonathan and the Diggers OPEN FIRE. When the smoke clears,
the Riders are either dead or gone. Jonathan grins.
JONATHAN
I say, bloody good show.
And then several more Mumia leap off the temple and land
behind them. Jonathan and the remaining Diggers spin around
and suddenly find themselves in hand-to-hand combat.
O'Connell is quickly loading his pistol. He hears something
THUNDERING UP behind him. He spins around just as Ardeth Bay
on a horse swings his scimitar. O'Connell instinctively
raises his hands to protect his face, the scimitar STRIKES!
Hits his gun, --CHING! O'Connell's gun flips away. Disarmed,
O'Connell dives and rolls and suddenly comes up with a stick
of dynamite in his hand. He shoves the fuse into a fire. It
IGNITES. He faces Ardeth Bay, towering above him. The two men
lock eyes. The fuse continues to burn down. Ardeth Bay points
his scimitar at O'Connell's head.
ARDETH BAY
LEAVE THIS PLACE! .... LEAVE THIS
PLACE OR DIE!
Ardeth Bay GALLOPS OFF. The remaining Mumia Riders race after
him, vanishing into the night. O'Connell watches them leave,
then turns to the burning fuse, ....and blows it out. Evelyn
staggers up, looking very shaken. O'Connell gently takes her
and holds her close.
O'CONNELL
You alright?
Evelyn looks up into his strong eyes. It's the first time
he's shown genuine concern for her. And she likes it. He's
also holding her a little too close. And she likes that too.
EVELYN
Yes, ...fine, ...thank you.
Beni crawls out from under some pillars as Henderson and
Burns help Daniels to his feet.
DANIELS
See! That proves it! Old Seti's
fortune's gotta be under this sand!
HENDERSON
For them to protect it like this,
you just know there's got to be
treasure down there.
O'Connell looks up into the surrounding ridges, unsatisfied.
O'CONNELL
These men are a desert people
they value water, not gold.
Evelyn looks at O'Connell, suddenly very worried.
EVELYN
Where's Jonathan?

PART 4

INT. EVELYN'S CABIN - NIGHT
Evelyn, wearing a nightgown, stands in front of a mirror. She
gives her head a good shake, letting her hair fall loose over
her bare shoulders. Then she turns around, RIGHT
THERE IS ONE OF THE HIDEOUS MUMIA! It's Hook. He slams his
hand over her mouth and lifts up his hook, ready to strike.
HOOK
Where is the map?
Evelyn's terrified eyes glance down. Hook looks over, sees
the map lying next to a flickering candle on a nearby table,
HOOK
And the key? Where is the key?
Evelyn's eyes look confused. She shakes her head. Hook grins,
HOOK
Then I'll find it myself,
He cocks his hook, about to kill her. And that's when the
door is KICKED OPEN. O'Connell BURSTS IN, gun in each hand.
Hook spins Evelyn around and holds her out in front of him.
O'Connell looks at her.
O'CONNELL
Friend of yours?
Evelyn's eyes widen. And that's when the candle on the table
FLICKERS. Everything happens at once, READ FAST: O'Connell
spins around just as a window BURSTS OPEN. A Mumia leans in.
FIRES A GUN. Woodchips BLAST OFF the wall next to O'Connell's
head. He returns FIRE. Kills the Mumia. The Mumia falls back.
FIRING BLINDLY.-A LANTERN in the room is BLASTED. Kerosene
SPLASHES across the wall. BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Evelyn grabs
the candle on the table and JAMS IT back over her shoulder,
right into Hook's EYE. He SCREECHES in pain and lets her go.
O'Connell grabs her and YANKS her out of the FLAMING ROOM.
HALLWAY - NIGHT
O'Connell pulls Evelyn down the hall, she tries to jerk free.
EVELYN
The map! We need the map!
He shoves her up against a wall.
O'CONNELL
Relax! I'm the map!
(taps his forehead)
It's all up here.
EVELYN
Oh that's comforting.
O'Connell gives her a look, then pulls her forward
O'CONNELL
C'mon, there's still one more of
those guys around here somewhere.
EVELYN'S FLAMING ROOM - NIGHT
Hot melted wax covers Hook's face as he holds his sore eye
and struggles to the door. Then he notices the key/box on the
floor. He bends over to pick it up. And that's when the door
is KICKED OPEN again, it hits him in the ass and knocks him
into the fire. Jonathan leans in. Sees nothing but flames.
JONATHAN
EVY!!
Then he sees the key/box on the floor and picks it up,
A HAND suddenly snatches the key/box away from him.
JONATHAN
Hey that's mine---
it's Hook. His backside is now ON FIRE. He lifts his pistol.
Jonathan quickly backpedals out the door as Hook OPENS FIRE.
EXT. CAMEL PADDOCK - NIGHT
O'Connell and Evelyn race out onto the deck near the horse
paddock. People are SCREAMING and SHOUTING, lots of panic.
BLAM! A chunk of the wall is BLOWN OFF next to Evelyn's head.
O'Connell pivots and FIRES BACK. It's the last Mumia, on the
other side of the paddock. He and O'Connell exchange GUNFIRE.
Another LANTERN BURSTS INTO FLAMES. O'Connell SHOOTS OFF the
paddock lock. The horses go nuts. O'Connell FIRES over their
heads. They CHARGE FORWARD and CRASH through the door. The
Mumia SCREAMS as the horses STAMPEDE over him. FLAMES sweep
up the walls and race across the roof. Half the barge is now
ON FIRE. O'Connell throws the gunny-sack over his shoulder.
O'CONNELL
Can you swim?
EVELYN
well of course I can swim, if
the occasion calls for it.
O'CONNELL
Trust me,
He picks her up and throws her over the side
O'CONNELL
The occasion calls for it.
Evelyn SPLASHES into the water. O'Connell dives in after her.
EXT. BARGE BOW - NIGHT
Jonathan runs out onto the bow, sees the three Americans,
guns in every hand, fanning their pistols, SHOOTING
everything in sight. Jonathan just shakes his head.
JONATHAN
Americans.
Hook suddenly stumbles up behind him, --now a FLAMING TORCH.
Jonathan turns around, Hook grabs him by the throat with his
FLAMING ARM and pins him to the cabin wall. Jonathan's eyes
widen as he sees a hook rising up inside the FLAMES about to
strike him. The Americans pivot and OPEN FIRE. Blow Hook over
the railing. Jonathan turns to the Americans and smiles.
JONATHAN
I say! Good show!
Then he points his thumb at himself
JONATHAN
And did I panic?
He lifts up his other hand, --he has the key/box back.
JONATHAN
I think not.
And that's when the horses STAMPEDE onto the bow. Jonathan
dives over one side, the three Americans dive over the other.
NILE RIVERBANK - NIGHT
O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden wade out of the
water. Evelyn's nightgown clings tight to her body as she
wrings it out. She looks good. O'Connell notices. Everybody
else, including the horses, is getting out on the far shore
O'Connell spots Beni running up to the Americans.
BENI
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me
like I got all the horses!
O'CONNELL
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your
on the wrong side of the river!
Beni looks up at the stars, then angrily KICKS the sand
CURSING. The FLAMING barge drifts off, slowly sinking ........
BEDOUIN TRADING POST - DAY
O'Connell barters in ARABIC with a CAMEL TRADER at a trading
post. Jonathan forks over some cash. The Trader hands them
the reins of four ugly old camels.
JONATHAN
I can't believe the price of
these fleabags.
O'CONNELL
We coulda had 'em for free, all
we had to do was give 'em your sister.

JONATHAN
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
O'CONNELL
Awfully.
And that's when Evelyn steps out of a trading tent. She's
changed into a gorgeous, tightly fitted, Bedouin dress.
O'CONNELL
Then again....
SAHARA DESERT SAND DUNES - DAY
O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the warden are on camels in
the middle of the frying pan; the endless, sunbaked Sahara.
JONATHAN
Never did like camels. Filthy
buggers. They smell, they bite,
they spit. Disgusting.
The warden savagely attacks a chicken wing with his vile
green teeth. Flies buzz around his head. He sucks at his
gums, then spits out some gristle. O'Connell watches him.
O'CONNELL
Yeah, disgusting.
Evelyn is having the time of her life on top of her camel.
EVELYN
Well I think they're cute.
WE DO SEVERAL TIME DISSOLVES: showing the majesty of the
desert, and our heroes getting deeper and deeper into it.
FRYING PAN - NIGHT
The MOON shines down an four lone camel rider's trekking
across the vast wasteland.
Jonathan is sound asleep, his head bobbing comically to
the rhythm of his camel. on the camel next to him, the
Warden SNORES LOUDLY. Up in front of them, Evelyn slowly
starts to slide off her saddle. O'Connell reaches over and
stops her, then gently pushes her back up onto her saddle,
never waking her. For a long moment, his eyes watch Evelyn,
and then he looks up at a distant ridge--
--where Ardeth Bay and a group of MUMIA RIDERS are pacing them.
EXT. GIANT SAND DUNE - ENDLESS HORIZON - DAY
The dawning sun hasn't yet crested the distant horizon as
Jonathan and the Warden ride alongside a giant sand dune.
JONATHAN
And you snore!
WARDEN
I do not snore!
JONATHAN
All night you snored!
WARDEN
I have never snored!
Up in front of them, O'Connell looks at Evelyn.
O'CONNELL
We're almost there.
EVELYN
Are you sure?
O'Connell looks down at the ground.
O'CONNELL
Pretty sure.
The others look down and see DOZENS OF SKELETONS sticking out
of the ground. Bleached and eaten away. Some of the skeletons
look like they're trying to crawl up out of the desert floor.
JONATHAN
what in bloody hell is this?
The Warden shivers in fear.
WARDEN
Other seekers of Hamunaptra.
The American Expedition rides out from behind the far end of
the dune. The Americans are accompanied by TWO DOZEN NATIVE
DIGGERS and an Arab EGYPTOLOGIST. Beni rides lead on a camel,
the rest ride horses.
BENI
Good morning, my friend!
O'Connell just nods. The two parties come to a stop a hundred
feet apart. O'Connell turns and stares out across the endless
horizon. Beni does likewise. The Americans look puzzled.
DANIELS
Well, what the hell we doin'?
BENI
Patience, my good sahib, patience.
Henderson looks over at O'Connell.
HENDERSON
First one to the city, O'Connell!
Five hundred! Cash bucks!
O'Connell and Beni just stare out at the flat nothingness.
Evelyn and Jonathan share a look. And then, the SUN starts to
rise in the distance, breaking the flat horizon.
O'CONNELL
Get ready.
Evelyn can feel the suspense and the majesty of the moment.
EVELYN
For what?
O'CONNELL
we're about to be shown the way.
Far off to the right, a HUGE SHAPE begins to rise with the
sun. A VOLCANO. O'Connell and Beni watch it, expressionless.
Daniels, Henderson and Burns share a look, and then--
DANIELS/HENDERSON/BURNS
HEYA!
The Americans take off. Racing towards the rising volcano.
DANIELS
SEE YA THERE, O'CONNELL!
Evelyn and Jonathan give O'Connell anxious, sarcastic looks.
JONATHAN
Ah, begging your pardon, but
shouldn't we be going?
EVELYN
After all, you rode us night
and day to win that bet.
O'Connell doesn't say a word, staring hard.
Beni watches the Americans and spits into the sand.
BENI
Fools

And then suddenly, the volcano SHIFTS ACROSS THE HORIZON.
Passing across the sun as it goes. --It's a MIRAGE.
The Americans crash their horses to a stop and race the other
way, after the volcano. Evelyn and Jonathan smile, amazed.
The volcano SHIFTS AGAIN, floating across the watery horizon.
The Americans crash to a stop again and chase after the
volcano. All three of them confused and CURSING. O'Connell
and Beni just stare, waiting. The volcano SHIFTS AGAIN. And
the Americans crash to a stop again. Burns is THROWN from his
horse. Henderson angrily rips his hat off and chucks it to
the ground. Daniels just curses as they give up the chase.
The volcano comes to a stop on the far left of the horizon.
The Americans are on the far right. Nothing moves. A BEAT.
And then O'Connell grins. So does Beni. They share a look.
And then SWAT their camels and RACE AWAY. Everybody else
hauls-ass after them. O'Connell and Beni are neck-and-neck.
And then Evelyn comes galloping up, hair flying in the wind.
Beni takes out his camel whip and starts WHIPPING O'Connell.
Trying to knock him off his camel. once. CRACK! Twice. CRACK!
But on the third try O'Connell grabs the whip and JERKS Beni
off his camel. Beni SLAMS to the ground and TUMBLES.
Evelyn and O'Connell race across the desert. Evelyn has never
felt so alive. She LAUGHS. O'Connell grins; he likes this
girl. Beni stumbles to his feet, then quickly dances out of
the way as Jonathan and all the other riders stampede past
him. Evelyn beats O'Connell to the stone ramp, racing hard.
O'CONNELL
Evelyn! Slow down!
Evelyn ignores him as she races up the ramp towards the gate.
O'CONNELL
SLOW DOWN, EVELYN! SLOW DOWN!
THERE'S A REALLY BIG--
INT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY
--Evelyn goes ass-over-teacups through the air and crash lands
in a sand dune. She sits up, stunned, sandy hair in her eyes.
O'Connell stops at the edge of the ramp next to her camel.
O'CONNELL
Never mind.
The Americans ride up and look in wonder at the ruins inside
the volcano. O'Connell gives them a big, shit-eating grin.
O'CONNELL
You boys owe me five hundred dollars.
ext. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY
Under the guidance of the Egyptologist, the Diggers are busy
hauling rock and dirt out of the Temple doorway. The three
Americans are playing poker. Beni smokes a hookah and swats
flies. Dozens of stray CAMELS roam the decrepit city; dusty
backpacks and old saddlebags still slung over their humps.
DANIELS
Where'd all these camels come from?
BENI
They belong to the dead. They
will wait years for their
masters to return before leaving.
EXT. OUR HEROES DIG - DAY
O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden are working next
to a narrow CREVICE, which weaves it's way through the ruins.
O'Connell ties a rope around a pillar and throws the rest of
the coils into the crevice, about to rappel down. Jonathan
bends over to have a look, his ass hits something, he YELPS
and backs away. It's the decrepit FACE OF ANUBIS.
JONATHAN
That thing gives me the creeps.
O'CONNELL
Be nice. That thing saved my life.
Evelyn is positioning ancient MIRRORS along the crevice.
EVELYN
That "thing" gets me excited
O'CONNELL
(sarcastic)
The things that get you excited.
EVELYN
According to Bembridge Scholars,
inside the statue of Anubis was
a secret compartment, perhaps
containing The Book Of The Living.
O'CONNELL
What are those mirrors for?
EVELYN
Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.
O'Connell shrugs, then rappels down into the crevice
INT. EMBALMER'S CHAMBER - DAY
O'Connell- waves a TORCH as Jonathan, Evelyn and the warden
drop down next to him. Evelyn peers into the spooky darkness.
EVELYN
Do you realize, we are standing
inside a room that no one has
entered in over four thousand years. 
WARDEN
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
O'CONNELL
You're welcome to my share of
the spider webs.
JONATHAN
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
Evelyn just rolls her eyes.
EVELYN
Cretins.
Jonathan sniffs the foul air, then he looks at the warden and
realizes where the smell is coming from. He stops sniffing.
Evelyn brushes COBWEBS away from a METAL DISK on the wall,
then repositions it on it's pedestal, aiming it at a RAY OF
LIGHT shining in from the outer mirrors. --THE RAY OF LIGHT
HITS THE DISK AND QUICKLY SHOOTS AROUND THE ROOM FROM ONE
DISK TO ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CHAMBER IS LIT UP. LIGHT RAYS
SHOOT OFF DOWN THE PASSAGEWAYS. It's the embalmer's chamber.
O'CONNELL
That is a neat trick.
EVELYN
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
O'CONNELL
Preparation for what?
EVELYN
For entering the afterlife
O'Connell quickly draws his gun. Jonathan gently nudges him,
JONATHAN
Mummies, my good son, this is
where they made the mummies.
Evelyn heads down a narrow passageway. The others follow.
INT. LABYRINTH - DAY
O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch as they make their way
through a narrow, COBWEB INFESTED LABYRINTH. The short, squat
warden can stand straight up. Then they hear something and
freeze. It sounds like somebody is clawing inside the walls.
They share looks. Then slowly move forward. Getting darker
and darker as they go. The strange sound getting louder and
louder. And then it stops. Evelyn holds her breath. Jonathan
licks his lips. O'Connell cocks his pistol. The warden FARTS.
O'Connell, Jonathan and Evelyn glare at him.
ANUBIS CHAMBER - DAY
They slowly creep -out of the labyrinth and up to the foot of
an enormous half-buried statue. The lower half of Anubis.
Then they hear the sound again, coming closer now, from the
other side of the statue. And closer. O'Connell pulls Evelyn
behind him. And closer. O'Connell raises his gun. And CLOSER!
O'Connell LEAPS OUT. --THREE HORRIBLE SWEATY FACES LUNGE AT
HIM. O'Connell REACTS. But doesn't pull the trigger because
it's just the Americans, their guns are up, cocked and aimed.
HENDERSON
Ya scared the bejeezus out of
us, O'Connell.
O'CONNELL
Likewise.
But nobody lowers their guns. Daniels grins, the tough one.
DANIELS
This here is our statue,...friend.
O'CONNELL
Don't see your name on it,...pal
And that's when Beni, five Diggers and the Egyptologist step
out of the shadows, --all holding guns aimed at O'Connell.
BENI
Ten to one, O'Connell, your
odds are no-so-good.
O'CONNELL
I've had worse
Jonathan clenches a tiny derringer.
JONATHAN
Yes, me too,
O'Connell gives him a sideways glance. Beni cocks his gun,
grinning, he wants it to happen. The tension thickens. Then
Evelyn gently takes O'Connell's gun hand and pulls it down.
EVELYN
Let's be nice, children, if
we're going to play together,
we must learn to share.
Evelyn pulls O'Connell away. Jonathan and the Warden follow.
Beni and the Americans slowly lower their guns, laughing. The
Egyptologist excitedly begins translating the hieroglyphs.
INT. IMHOTEPIS CHAMBER - DAY
O'Connell and Jonathan are using sledge-hammers against the
ceiling. Evelyn is gently chipping away with a tiny chisel.
EVELYN
According to my calculations,
we should be right under the
statue. We'll come up right
between his legs.
(she blushes and laughs)
Oh my.
JONATHAN
And when those dirty Yanks go
to sleep--
(looks at O'Connell)
No offense.
O'CONNELL
None taken
JONATHAN
--We'll sneak up and steal that
book right out from under them.
O'CONNELL
And you're sure you can find the
secret compartment?
EVELYN
Yes, if their Egyptologist hasn't
already found it.
Jonathan looks around.
JONATHAN
I say, what's our smelly little
friend got himself up to?

PART 6

EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT
Jonathan falls into FRAME. Hits the ground. Eyes wide open.
Mouth agape. Clearly dead. A BEAT. And then his eyes close
and his mouth widens into a goofy smile. Shit-faced drunk.
O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, both half-in-the-bag themselves,
the bottle of Seagrams is almost gone. O'Connell offers the
bottle to Evelyn, she waves it away, slurring badly--
EVELYN
Unlike my brother, sir, I know
when to say no.
O'Connell polishes off the bottle and chucks it away.
O'CONNELL
Unlike your brother, Miss, you
I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
EVELYN
I know, you're wondering, what's
a place like me doing in a girl
like this?
O'CONNELL
Something like that.
EVELYN
Egypt is in my blood. My father
was a famous explorer, he loved
Egypt so much that he married
an Egyptian my mother! who
was quite an adventurer herself
O'CONNELL
Okay, I get your father, I get
your mother and I get your brother,
but what are you doing here?
Evelyn is insulted, she staggers to her feet.
EVELYN
I may not be an explorer, or an
adventurer, or a treasure hunter,
or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell
But I'm proud of what I am.
O'CONNELL
And what is that?
Evelyn plops back down beside him, really drunk, she grins
and proudly lifts her head high.
EVELYN
..... am a librarian!
She leans in, very close to his face, looks him in the eyes,
EVELYN
I'm going to kiss you, Mister
O'Connell.
O'CONNELL
No you're not.
EVELYN
I'm not?
O'CONNELL
Not unless you call me Rick
EVELYN
Why would I do that?
O'CONNELL
Because that's my name.
She gives him a goofy smile. He leans forward and KISSES HER.
Evelyn's eyes slowly close. And then she passes out, slumping
into his arms. O'Connell looks down at her, and just smiles.
INT. IMHOTEPIS CHAMBER - DAY
Evelyn's HAND slips the KEY into the sarcophagus, lock and
turns it. A series of STRANGE MECHANICAL-LIKE SOUNDS are
heard, and then the sarcophagus unlocks with a GIANT HISS.
O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan all look very, very hungover.
They start to slide the heavy lid off the sarcophagus.
PUSHING, SHOVING and GROANING, the lid budging, inch by inch.
EVELYN
.I can't believe I allowed the
two of you to get me drunk.
JONATHAN
Don't blame me, I don't even
remember being there.
EVELYN
well neither do I, thank you.
O'Connell gives her a hurt look.
O'CONNELL
You don't?
Evelyn gives O'Connell a nervous look.
EVELYN
No . .... Why? .... Should I?
O'CONNELL
Gee, yeah, you told me it was
the best time you ever had.
O'Connell gives her a big cheesy smile. Evelyn's face drops,
appalled and embarrassed. And that's when the lid FALLS OFF
and LOUDLY CRASHES to the ground. All three of them instantly
grab their sore heads and MOAN.
INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY
Several fear-filled, sweaty-faced Diggers reach into the
secret compartment. Henderson and Burns hold guns on them.
Daniels has his arm in a sling. The Diggers slowly pull out
the ORNATE CHEST. They set the chest down on the sandy floor.
Beni watches as the Egyptologist translates the hieratics.
EGYPTOLOGIST
There is a curse upon this chest.
DANIELS
Curse My ass.
HENDERSON
Yeah, who cares.
The Egyptologist gives them the evil-eye
EGYPTOLOGIST
In these hallowed grounds, that
which was set forth in ancient
times, is as strong today, as
it was then.
HENDERSON
Yeah, yeah, okay, what's it
The Egyptologist slowly and carefully reads the inscription:
EGYPTOLOGIST
"Death will come on swift wings
to whomever opens this chest".
A GUST OF WIND blows through the chamber. TORCHES FLICKER
All-the Diggers suddenly turn tail and run off SCREAMING.
The Americans look at each other, suddenly very nervous.
EGYPTOLOGIST
It says, there is one, the undead,
who if brought back to life, is
bound by sacred law to consummate
this curse.
HENDERSON
Yeah, well, let's just make sure
we don't bring anybody back from
the dead then, huh?
The three Americans laugh.
EGYPTOLOGIST
He will kill all who open this
chest, ...and assimilate their
organs and fluids.
DANIELS
Assimilate their organs and fluids?
Ya mean eat 'em?
EGYPTOLOGIST
And in so doing he will regenerate.
And no longer be the undead, but a
plague upon this earth.

The WIND WHISTLES. Torches FLICKER. VERY SPOOKY. Beni and the
Egyptologist share a fear-filled look. Henderson just shrugs.
HENDERSON
Ah hell, let's open it anyways,
INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY
WHAM! Imhotep's wooden coffin is DROPPED to the ground next
to his stone sarcophagus. Evelyn is very excited.
EVELYN
Oh my god, love dreamed about
this ever since I was a little girl.
O'CONNELL
You dream about dead guys?
Evelyn just gives him a look, then starts brushing dirt and
cobwebs off the top of the coffin. Then she freezes.
EVELYN
Look, all the sacred spells have
been chiseled off. The hieratics
and hieroglyphs that protect the
deceased on his journey into the
afterlife, they've been removed.
This man was cursed, ....doomed.
O'Connell and Jonathan are too excited to care
O'CONNELL
Tough break.
JONATHAN
Yes, I'm all tears, now let's
see who's inside, shall we?
Evelyn can't believe these guys. Jonathan inserts the key/box
into the coffin's lock. Turns it. The lid cracks open with a
HISS. They all react to the FOUL STENCH. Then O'Connell grabs
the lid. It's stuck. He pulls with all his might. Jonathan
helps him. It starts to give way. Slowly. Slowly. Slooooowly.
And then it suddenly POPS OPEN and THE MOST HIDEOUS, MAGGOT-
INFESTED, ROTTEN CORPSE IMAGINABLE JUMPS UP!
O'CONNELL/EVELYN/JONATHAN
AHHHHH!!!
They all jump back. Scared to death. Imhotep is now the
'Elephant Man' of corpses; twisted and deformed. The years
have not been kind. He slumps back into his coffin.
INT. ANUBIS'-CHAMBER - DAY
Henderson and Daniels start to pry at the lid of the wooden
chest. Beni and the Egyptologist watch. In the background,
Beni starts backing away, filled with fear, sweating buckets.
BENI
The curse, ....beware the curse!
turns and bolts from the chamber. Daniels spits.
DANIELS
Stupid superstitious bastard.
And that's when the seal breaks, --A BLACK VAPOR BLASTS OUT
OF THE CHEST. Everybody vanishes into the strange cloud.
INT. IMHOTEPIS CHAMBER - DAY
O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan slowly creep forward and
carefully look back inside Imhotep's coffin, creeped-out
O'CONNELL
is he supposed to look like that?
EVELYN
No. I've never seen a mummy look
like this. He's, he's still...

JONATHAN
Juicy?
EVELYN
Yes. He's more than four thousand
years old and still decomposing.
O'CONNELL
And look at this.
O'Connell points at the inside of the COFFIN LID, where there
are FINGERNAIL SCRATCHES and DRIED BLOOD all over the inside.
EVELYN
Oh my god, he was buried alive,
This sends a chill through everyone. Evelyn leans in closer,
EVELYN
And he left a message.
WE PUSH IN on a grouping of hieratics WRITTEN IN BLOOD.
EVELYN
It says: 'Death is only the beginning*
Jonathan shivers. O'Connell looks around.
O'CONNELL
Where's my gun?
JONATHAN
What are you going to do?
Shoot him?
O'CONNELL
If he decides to wakes up, hell yes!
INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY
The vapor is settling. The Americans have their guns aimed at
the chest. The Egyptologist slowly steps up, reaches inside,
and lifts out a heavy burlap bag. Everyone's eyes widen in
excitement as he sticks his hand into the bag and slowly
pulls out the black BOOK OF THE DEAD, the same book Imhotep
used in his attempt to bring Anck-su-namun back to life.
EGYPTOLOGIST
I have heard told of this book,
but I never truly believed it
existed. This, good gentlemen,
is a most priceless treasure.
Henderson kicks the sandy floor in anger.
HENDERSON
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass
spittoon!
DANIELS
Yeah! It's supposed to be made
outta pure gold!
Daniels kicks the chest. it breaks open, unfolding to reveal
a lower compartment. Inside, are Anck-su-namun's FIVE JEWEL
ENCRUSTED CANOPIC JARS (one is shattered and without jewels)
EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT
The two camps have now joined together. O'Connell and Beni
are roasting chunks of hairy meat over a fire. Jonathan
wrinkles his nose, disgusted by the smell.
JONATHAN
What is this stuff? It smells
like our late friend, the warden.
O'Connell and Beni both grin. Jonathan looks horrified.

JONATHAN
You did not!? .... We're not!?
O'CONNELL
Rat gizzards. They smell bad
and taste worse, but that's the
best the desert has to offer.
The gloating Americans sit down, fondling their jeweled jars.
HENDERSON
Say O'Connell, whadaya think
these honey's'll fetch back home?
BURNS
we hear you gentlemen found yerselves
a nice gooey mummy. Congratulations.
DANIELS
Ya know if ya dry him out, you
can sell him for firewood.
The Americans laugh. Evelyn walks up, sits down and drops a
pile of big dusty BUG SKELETONS onto the ground.
EVELYN
Scarabs, flesh eaters, I found
them inside our friend's coffin.
They can stay alive for years
living off the flesh of a corpse,
or in this case ........
She shrugs, then looks at the roasting meat
EVELYN
famished.
O'Connell and Jonathan stare at the bug skeletons, disgusted.
O'CONNELL
Are you saying somebody threw
these things in with our guy,
and they slowly ate him alive?
EVELYN
Very slowly.
JONATHAN
He certainly was not a popular
fellow when they planted him.
O'CONNELL
Must of got a little too frisky
with the Pharaoh's daughter.

EVELYN
According to my readings, our
friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the
worst of all ancient Egyptian
curses, one reserved for only
the most evil blasphemers. In
all of my research, I've never
read of this curse actually
having been performed.
O'CONNELL
That bad huh?
EVELYN
Yes, they never used it because
they feared it so. it's written,
that if a victim of the HOM-DAI
should ever arise, he would bring
with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
O'CONNELL
The ten plagues? ... You mean all 
ten plagues.
BENI
Like what that Moses guy did
to that Pharaoh guy?
EVELYN
That's one way of putting it.
JONATHAN
Let's see, there was frogs, flies,
locusts....
BURNS
Hail and fire.
HENDERSON
The sun turning black.
DANIELS
Water turning to blood.
JONATHAN
And my personal favorite: people
covered in boils and sores.
All the men share nervous looks, really spooked. Evelyn just
laughs at them, then pulls a meat stick out of the fire.
EVELYN
Fried gizzard anyone?

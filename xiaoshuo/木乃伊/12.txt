PART 12

INT. CEMETERY - DAY
Imhotep prepares the altar while speaking in HEBREW. Beni
holds his gun on her, translating:
BENI
Prince Imhotep wants your heart.
Evelyn blushes, feeling complimented by the handsome prince.
EVELYN
Tell him, I'm truly flattered.
... but that it's already taken.
Imhotep continues SPEAKING while laying the four jewel
encrusted canopic jars next to the shattered one.
BENI
He wants your heart and your
brain, your liver, your kidneys...
Evelyn's eyes widen
BENI
... and how do you say? Those
slimy things, in your stomach?
EVELYN
Intestines
BENI
Yeah! Them.
Evelyn can't believe it, she furiously turns to Imhotep.
EVELYN
You only want me for my organs?!
Imhotep looks at her and grins, then BACKHANDS her --WAP!
Evelyn goes down for the count. Imhotep stares at her, cold,
malevolent, then h e turns and walks off into the mausoleums.
Beni nervously glances around, then quickly scurries away.
TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY
O'Connell squeezes through a small crevice in a wall and
drops to the floor of a dark chamber. He picks up his gunny-
sack and scans the darkness. Something GLITTERS. Jonathan and
Ardeth Bay crawl in behind him.
O'Connell notices a SHAFT OF LIGHT, high above him, shooting
through a small hole in the ceiling and stopping against a
wall next to one of those mirror disks. O'Connell aims his
gun. FIRES. The bullet STRIKES the disk's pedestal, spinning
the mirror into the shaft of light, --And WHAM! THE SHAFT OF
LIGHT HITS THE DISK AND QUICKLY BOUNCES AROUND THE ROOM FROM
ONE DISK TO ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CHAMBER IS LIT UP.
It's an enormous TREASURE CHAMBER. Filled to overflowing.
Everything sparkles and shines. The wealth of Egypt.
O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay are speechless.
that's when the two mummified Priest-mummies walk in.
O'CONNELL
who the hell are these guys?
ARDETH BAY
Priests. Imhotep's priests.
O'Connell pulls the elephant gun out of his gunny-sack.
O'CONNELL
I never killed a priest before,
ARDETH BAY
They are evil, cursed, they
matter not.
O'CONNELL
Well, okay then.
O'Connell FIRES the elephant gun. SMOKE and FLAME shoot out.
BLASTS one of the mummies. Blows it's upper torso clean off.
O'Connell pumps the gun, the huge spent cartridge flips
through the air. He FIRES again. BLASTS the other mummy,
b1ows this one's torso clean off as well. The smoke clears.
The two sets of LEGS keep walking forward, unaffected by the
loss of their upper torsos. O'Connell can't believe it.
O'CONNELL
Oh come on, gimme a break here.
And then the disemboweled upper torsos start to move, turning
over and crawling towards our heroes, who start to back away.
INT. CEMETERY -DAY
Imhotep turns from the altar as he hears more GUNSHOTS
echoing out of the passageways. He angrily reaches into
another of Anck-su-namun's canopic jars, pulls out her crusty
liver and crushes it to dust, then quickly starts reading a
passage from the Book and BLOWS the dust down a passageway.
IMHOTEP (ancient Egyptian - subtitled)
Kill them! Kill them all! And
bring me the Book Of The Living!
INT. TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY
A dusty BREEZE blows into the chamber as O'Connell, Jonathan
and Ardeth Bay back away from the mummy pieces. The floor
where they were just standing suddenly STARTS TO MOVE. Two
more mummies slowly dig their way up out of the floor. More
mummies start coming out of the walls and crawling out of the
piles of gold. All the mummies head for our heroes. O'Connell
lifts the elephant gun. Ardeth Bay stops him.
ARDETH BAY
My turn.
Ardeth Bay OPENS UP with the Lewis gun. BLASTING the shit out
of the mummies. They keep on coming. Even more now. O'Connell
OPENS FIRE with the elephant gun, pumping and FIRING as all
three of the men back away and haul-ass. The mummies and
mummy pieces follow them into the passageway.
Then Beni creeps into the chamber. He stares in wonder at all
the treasure. Then falls backwards into a pile of jewels and
rolls about.
INT. CEMETERY - DAY
Evelyn-wakes up, lying chained to the top of the altar.
She blink!, then turns her head, --and looks right into
the ROTTED FACE of Anck-su-namun's corpse. Evelyn SCREAMS.
INT. LABYRINTH PASSAGEWAYS - DAY
The elephant gun FIRES, blasting FLAME and SMOKE right into
the LENS. O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay race down a
passageway, a dozen mummies striding after them.
O'CONNELL
This whole place is comin, alive!
The men race around a corner. More mummies. They race around
another corner. More mummies. Onward they come. Methodical.
Relentless. Boxing in our heroes. O'Connell and Ardeth Bay
FIRING as they go. Ardeth Bay goes empty.
ARDETH BAY
I'm out
He throws the machine-gun down and they all race into--
HORUS CHAMBER - DAY
--A small chamber. The lower half of the giant statue of
HORUS stands in the middle of the chamber.
JONATHAN
There he is!
They run up to the base of the statue,
JONATHAN
Hello Horus old boy.
O'Connell looks back at the mummies coming down the
passageway. He reaches into his gunny-sack and pulls out
a stick of dynamite. Ardeth Bay taps him on the shoulder.
ARDETH BAY
Allow me.
O'Connell hands him the dynamite and a match, then turns to
look at the statue. Ardeth Bay reaches forward and strikes
the match off O'Connell's stubbly face. O'Connell YELPS.
Ardeth Bay lights the dynamite and throws it down the
passageway. They all hit the deck. The dynamite EXPLODES.
Ripping apart the creatures, causing a CAVE-IN and sealing
the passageway with rock and dirt. Now there's only one way
out, --another dark, creepy passageway.
INT. CEMETERY
Chained tight to the top of the altar, Evelyn hopelessly
struggles to free herself. She stops as Priest mummies start
surrounding the altar. Evelyn is horrified as the hideous
mummies kneel down and begin to CHANT, --which now sounds
even more horrific due to the lack of tongues, jaws and
mouths in the room.
Imhotep steps up carrying the black Book Of The Dead.
His hand reaches out and lovingly caresses Anck-su-namun's
decayed cheek.
INT. HORUS CHAMBER - DAY
O'Connell and Jonathan are digging away at the seams of the
secret compartment, it starts to give. And that's when Ardeth
Bay spots another group of rotting mummies coming down the
dark passageway, heading right for them. O'Connell looks up.
O'CONNELL
These guys just don't quit.
Ardeth Bay grabs the elephant gun and a handful of shells and
runs off towards the mummies.
ARDETH BAY
Keep digging!
O'Connell and Jonathan redouble their efforts, pulling harder
on the seam. The compartment starts to loosen. About to give.
The last time this happened, salt acid sprayed out, remember?
Our heroes keep tugging. The tension mounts ................
And that's when a SKELETAL HAND BURSTS UP OUT OF THE GROUND
and grabs O'Connell's ankle. Several more moldy hands BURST
up out of the ground. O'Connell and Jonathan struggle with
the mummies as they crawl up out of the dirt floor.
One of the mummies violently shoves O'Connell away. Another
grabs Jonathan by the throat and starts to strangle him. A
third mummy grabs at the secret compartment and pulls hard.
AN INTENSE BURST OF ACID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM AND HITS ALL
THREE OF THE MUMMIES. The one strangling Jonathan gets it in
the back and drops him. All three mummies melt horribly.
INT. CEMETERY
Imhotep begins to read from The Book Of The Dead.
A large SWIRLING HOLE starts to open in the detritus bog.
Evelyn's eyes widen in amazement and horror.
IINT. HORUS CHAMBER - DAY
Ardeth Bay BLASTS AWAY at the oncoming mummies.
over at the base of the statue, O'Connell and Jonathan pull
an ornate chest out of the secret compartment. O'Connell rips
off the lid, reaches inside and pulls out a heavy burlap bag.
He and Jonathan exchange nervous, excited looks. Then he
reaches into the bag and slowly pulls out the SOLID GOLD Book
Of The Living- GOLDEN LIGHT reflects off their faces as they
stare at it in wonder.
The elephant gun goes empty. Ardeth Bay takes it by the
barrel and wades into the remaining mummies swinging.
ARDETH BAY
Save the girl! Kill the creature!
The mummies quickly overwhelm and start to tear him apart.
O'Connell lights the last stick of dynamite and throws it
against the far wall. He and Jonathan hit the deck.
O'CONNELL
That's the last one, we better
get lucky.
The wall BLOWS. Debris COLLAPSES, --but now here's a hole for
them to get out. O'Connell and Jonathan race out through the
hole just as the remaining mummies enter the chamber.
EXT. HAMUNAPTRA RUINS - DAY
Outside, Beni staggers across the sand with a saddlebag
filled with treasure. He throws it over the rear of a camel.
Starts to climb up. Hesitates. Looks back at the temple door.
Licks his lips. And then his greed gets the better of him and
he quickly climbs down and scurries back towards the door.

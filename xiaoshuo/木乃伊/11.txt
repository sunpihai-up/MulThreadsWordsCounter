PART 11

INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay slosh their way down the
watery catacomb, crazies pouring in behind them. Up ahead, a
LIGHT suddenly shines in from another cistern hole, and then
more of the infected crowd drop down, SCREECHING like rats.
O'Connell jags right, pushing Jonathan and Ardeth Bay ahead
of him, he strikes a match off the wall, lights the nubby
fuse on a stick of dynamite, throws it, and runs like hell.
FIRE BLAST incinerates a bunch of crazies.
STREET - ALLEY - NIGHT
The EXPLOSION blows a cistern cover fifty feet into the air,
followed by a mass of FLAMMAGE ..............
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
A sewer grate is kicked out of a wall. O'Connell, Jonathan
and Ardeth Bay climb out of the hole and into AN ALLEY.
O'CONNELL
We gotta get her back.
JONATHAN
I'm with you, old man. No one
touches my sister like that and
gets away with it.
O'Connell looks at Ardeth Bay,
O'CONNELL
You know where he's taking her?
ARDETH BAY
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform
the ritual.
Jonathan looks worried.
JONATHAN
And what ritual would that be?
ARDETH BAY
The ritual to bring the body of
Anck-su-namun back to life.
JONATHAN
And how does one do that?
ARDETH BAY
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
JONATHAN
Oh yes, of course.
ARDETH BAY
And then killing your sister.
JONATHAN
Excuse me?
Ardeth Bay looks at O'Connell,
ARDETH BAY
Imhotep is now able to cross the
desert with great haste.
Jonathan taps him in the shoulder,
JONATHAN
Begging your pardon, but I wasn't
quite clear on that last part.
Ardeth Bay ignores him,
ARDETH BAY
If he arrives before us, it will
be too late.
JONATHAN
Did you say 'kill' my sister?
O'Connell smiles
O'CONNELL
I know how to beat him to it.
And on that WE SMASH CUT TO-- THE ERFOUD DUNES - DAWN
Jonathan's bashed-in convertible steams it's way up to a set
of semi-abandoned Quonset huts. A single WWI BIPLANE with
R.A.F. INSIGNIAS sits in the sand beside them. A SIGN READS:
HIS MAJESTY'S ROYAL AIR CORP
EXT. QUONSET HUT - DUNES - MINUTES LATER
O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay stand before Winston
Havlock, the massive dunes of Erfoud as our background.
WINSTON
So what's your little problem
got to do with His Majesty's
Royal Air Corp?
O'CONNELL
Not a god-damned thing.
Winston looks intrigued.
WINSTON
is it dangerous?
O'CONNELL
You probably won't live through it,
This really interests him.
WINSTON
By Jove, do you really think so?
JONATHAN
Everybody else we've bumped into
has died, why not you?
Winston nods his head, he's hooked.
WINSTON
So what's the challenge then?
O'CONNELL
To save the damsel in distress,
kill the bad guy and steal his
treasure.
A slow grin spreads across Winston's face, then he gives them
a snappy salute.
WINSTON
Winston Havlock at your service, sir!
SAHARA - DAY
Way off across the desert, a large SAND-DEVIL races over the
dunes. The SANDY WHIRLWIND comes to a stop and starts to
dissipate. Evelyn and Beni are suddenly ejected out of it,
they land in a dune. The SWIRLING SAND CONDENSES AND FORMS
INTO IMHOTEP. He looks up into the sky, listening carefully.
Evelyn shakes the sand out of her hair and looks at Beni.
EVELYN
what just happened?
BENI
All I remember is him turning
into a blast of sand, ....and
then I remember nothing.
then they hear a plane in the sky and look up.
INT. BIPLANE - DAY
The WIND whips at Winston in the cockpit. O'Connell sits in
the gunner's compartment. Jonathan is strapped spread-eagle
across the left wing, Ardeth Bay is tied tight to the right.
Both men are scared out of their wits and SCREAMING in fear.

EXT. SAHARA - DAY
Imhotep's jaw UNHINGES, his mouth opens to an inhuman size,
he lets fly with another one of his horrible SHRIEKS. --And
a massive WALL OF SAND rises up out of the desert
BIPLANE - DAY
O'Connell watches the desert below him come alive and rise
up towards the plane. Winston looks over the side and sees
what's coming. He laughs, throws the throttle, and puts the
plane into a dive.
WINSTON
Hang on, men!
WE GO WIDE AS: The sandstorm chases the diving, twisting
biplane. Getting closer and closer, about to engulf it.
O'Connell looks back into the blinding sand and sees a GIANT
FACE forming inside the sandstorm. It's Imhotep. Grinning.
O'Connell grabs the Lewis machine-gun, cocks the bracket and
FIRES, blasting away at Imhotep's giant face inside the
sandstorm. Imhotep's face begins to laugh, then his jaw
unhinges, his mouth opens wide, and he ENGULFS the plane.
Winston blindly fights for control, elated.
WINSTON
We're going down!
The biplane SPINS inside the BLOWING SAND. Engines ROARING.
Wind HOWLING. Jonathan and Ardeth Bay SCREAMING. Winston
Havlock LAUGHING.
WINSTON
Here I come, laddies!
O'Connell braces himself for impact,
SAHARA - DAY
Evelyn leaps to her feet and runs over to Imhotep.
EVELYN
Stop it! You'll kill them!
Imhotep grabs her, pulls her close, her beautiful eyes stare
into his shockingly intense ones. Then he kisses her, hard.
Evelyn's eyes widen, stunned and mesmerized, then she pushes
herself away and falls back into the sand. Imhotep laughs.

EXT. BIPLANE - DUNES - DAY
The biplane SMASHES over a dune, ROLLS OVER and CRASHES
upside-down into another dune. The SAND SWIRLS as O'Connell
falls out of the gunner's compartment. The left wing is
jammed into the dune, Jonathan hangs upside down.
JONATHAN
Excuse me. ...A little help
would be useful. ...IF IT'S
NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE!!
O'Connell goes to help Jonathan. Ardeth Bay stumbles over to
the gunner's compartment and tears the Lewis gun off it's
mount. He throws the machine-gun over one shoulder, a
cartridge belt over the other and staggers away. O'Connell
and Jonathan look into the cockpit. Winston Havlock is dead.
A smile on his face. The plane suddenly starts to move, the
sand sinks under their feet, they quickly high-tail-it away.
O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay make it to some rocks and
look back. The biplane, with Winston Havlock inside, slides
away over a dune. O'Connell gives it a salute. The plane
vanishes over the dune and into the SWIRLING SAND ...........
HAMUNAPTRA - DAY
O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay come down a ravine in the
volcano and look out over the ruins of Hamunaptra.
O'CONNELL
Okay, now what the hell does
this Horus guy look like?
JONATHAN
He's a big fellow with pointy
ears and a face like a falcon.
O'CONNELL
Got it
HAMUNAPTRA STAIRWAY - DAY
Carrying TORCHES, O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay make
their way down a long, winding, narrow staircase. Heading
into the bowels of the necropolis. A passageway to hell.
NECROPOLIS - DAY
Evelyn follows Imhotep into the underground cemetery.
She stops at the sight of all the big hairy rats scurrying
through the mausoleums and over the gravestones. Beni shoves
his rifle into her back and pushes her forward.
BENI
Keep moving
Evelyn gives him a look.
EVELYN
You know, nasty little fellows
such as yourself, always get
their comeuppance.
Beni suddenly looks worried.
BENI
Yeah?
EVELYN
Oh yes, always,
Beni looks even more worried, he nervously starts chewing on
his lip. All three of them walk over the bridge crossing the
disgusting DETRITUS MOAT. Evelyn looks down at it, horrified.
INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY
O'Connell and Ardeth Bay are busy digging out a collapsed
doorway. Jonathan notices an AMETHYST SCARAB on the far wall.
JONATHAN
I say, look at that.
He walks over and tries to jiggle it free. It comes loose in
his hand. He looks at the scarab in his palm. It starts to
glow. And then something inside it starts to WIGGLE.
JONATHAN
Say, gents! You should come
have a look at this.
The wiggling continues; a long, agonizing BEAT, and then the
scarab breaks out of it's cocoon and instantly BURROWS into
Jonathan's palm. Jonathan starts to freak out and SCREAM.
O'Connell runs up and rips the arm off Jonathan's shirt. The
scarab is now BURROWING UP JONATHAN'S ARM. O'Connell whips
out his butterfly-knife, snaps it open and grabs Jonathan's
arm. Jonathan's eyes widen in terror as the knife passes in
front of his face. Jonathan SCREAMS LOUDER, obviously being
cut open. O'Connell's hand flicks something away.
The scarab hits the floor and immediately starts scurrying
back towards Jonathan, wanting to finish the job.
O'Connell pulls out his gun and blows it away, --BLAM!
INT. CEMETERY - DAY
The GUNSHOT echoes into the cemetery as Imhotep, Evelyn and
Beni step6up to the strange ALTAR, where four thousand years
ago Imhotep tried to bring Anck-su-namun back to life.
Imhotep scowls at the sound and angrily reaches into a
CANOPIC JAR. He pulls out the crusted remains of Anck-su-
namun's heart, crushes it to dust in his hand and starts
reading from The Book Of The Dead. Then he BLOWS the dust
against a mausoleum wall, --THE WALL STARTS TO COME ALIVE.
Evelyn and Beni stare at the wall, both of them wide-eyed.
TWO FORMS emerge from the mausoleum's wall. Horrific-looking
mummified CORPSES. , Two of Imhotep's long dead Priests. They
bow to Imhotep,-then turn and move off down a passageway.
INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY
O'Connell helps Ardeth Bay mend Jonathan's wound.
O'CONNELL
From now on, don't touch anything.
Not a damn thing. Keep your hands
off the furniture, got it?
Jonathan swallows hard and nods vigorously.

PART 8

EXT. RUINS - NIGHT
O'Connell and Jonathan boost Evelyn up onto a camel. Daniels
and Henderson throw Burns up onto another. The Egyptologist,
still clutching The Book Of The Dead, gets up on yet another.
They all head off into the dark, windblown desert ..........

And then in the extreme foreground, A SKELETAL HAND SUDDENLY
PUNCHES UP OUT OF THE SAND, ACCOMPANIED BY THE MOST HORRIFIC,
PRIMORDIAL SHRIEK IMAGINABLE---
IMHOTEP
ANCK-SU-NAMUUUUUN!!!!
EXT. BRITISH FORT - CAIRO - DAY
A British flag flies over BRITISH SOLDIERS manning the front
gate. our tired, disheveled Heroes saunter up on their dusty
camels. The Soldiers check their papers, then let them enter.
INT. EVELYN'S QUARTERS - DAY
A steamer trunk is slammed to the floor and thrown open.
O'Connell chucks a load of DRESSES into the trunk.
O'CONNELL
I thought you didn't believe
in this stuff!?
O'Connell heads for the closet. Evelyn UNPACKS the dresses
EVELYN
Having an encounter with a four
thousand year old walking-talking
corpse tends to convert one.
O'CONNELL
Forget it, we're out the door
down the hall and gone.
EVELYN
No, we are not,
O'Connell throws a handful of her underthings into the trunk,
O'CONNELL
Oh yes we are.
O'Connell continues to PACK Evelyn's clothes as she continues
to UNPACK them:
EVELYN
No we are not. We woke him up,
and we must try and stop him.
O'CONNELL
We?! What we?! You didn't
read that book. I told you not
to play around with that thing.
EVELYN
Alright then, Me, I, ...I read the
book, I woke him up and I intend
to stop him.
O'Connell angrily stretches a bra between his hands.
O'CONNELL
How!? You heard the man, no mortal
weapons can kill this guy.
Evelyn grabs the bra and throws it into a drawer.
EVELYN
Then we'll have to find some
immortal ones.
O'CONNELL
There goes that alieff again. Not
me, I am outta here!
O'Connell stuffs a pile of Evelyn's shoes into the trunk.
Evelyn KICKS the lid shut, slamming it on his fingers.
O'Connell YELPS and angrily storms around the room sucking
his fingers as Evelyn follows him.
EVELYN
According to that Book, once
this creature has been reborn,
his curse will spread, and as
he grows in strength, so will
his curse grow, infecting the
people until the whole of the
earth is destroyed.
O'CONNELL
Yeah? So? Is that My problem?
EVELYN (incredulous)
It's everybody's problem!
O'CONNELL
Look lady, I appreciate you
saving my life and all, but
when I signed on, I agreed to
take you out there and bring
you back, and I did, now were
even, end of job, end of story,
contract terminated.
EVELYN
That's what I am to you? A contract?

O'CONNELL
You can either tag along with me,
or you can stay here and play
around with Mister Maggot.
EVELYN
I'm staying.
O'CONNELL
FINE
O'Connell storms out and SLAMS the door. A BEAT. Then the
door opens and O'Connell's hand reaches back in and throws a
handful of frilly panties to the floor. SLAM goes the door.
EXT. BRITISH FORT COMPOUND - DAY
O'Connell angrily strides through the compound. He sees Beni
coming up the path with a MAN dressed in hooded robes, his
face covered by an ornate death mask. Imhotep disguised.
O'CONNELL
Beni ya little stinkweed,
where did you slink off to?
BENI
You left me! You left me in
the desert to rot.
O'CONNELL
Oh yeah, ....sorry bout that
(gestures to Imhotep)
So who's this guy?
BENI
This is Prince Imhotep, High
Priest of Osiris.

O'CONNELL
Oh, hey, how ya doin'?
O'Connell sticks out his hand, --Imhotep instantly recoils
O'Connell gives him the once-over. Beni quickly covers.
BENI
The Prince does not like to be
touched by other humans. A Silly
eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
O'CONNELL
Yeah, well, we all got our
little problems today don't we?

BENI
He has come to help Mister Burns
Somehow I feel responsible.
O'CONNELL
Don't gimme that, you never had
any scruples.
BENI
Do you know where I can steal some?
O'Connell fake-punches him. Beni flinches. O'Connell gives
Imhotep a look as he strides off.
O'CONNELL
See ya around, Padre.
Imhotep's grotesque new eyes glare out from behind the mask.
INT. CASBAH - DAY
The proverbial den-of-iniquity. Hard men, hard women and hard
liquor. Lots of deals going down. An OLDER GUY with a walrus
mustache is drunk and talking to some tough customers. He
wears British WWI fighter pilot gear. Meet WINSTON HAVLOCK.
WINSTON
I'm the last of the Royal Force
still stationed here, you know?
All the other laddies died in the
air and were buried in the sand.
The tough customers shove him away. Winston staggers over to
O'Connell and Jonathan at the bar, not missing a beat.
WINSTON
Ever since the end of the Great
War, there hasn't been a single
challenge worthy of a man like me.
O'CONNELL
I've heard it before, Winston,
O'Connell shoves him away. Winston staggers back to Jonathan.
WINSTON
I just wish I would've chucked
it with the other laddies,
gone down in a flame of glory,
instead of sitting around here,
rotting from boredom and booze!
Jonathan shoves him towards another group of unlucky sods
Henderson and Daniels sidle up to the bar next to them.

Burns, now tongue-less, talks with a severe impediment
BURNS
The drawer there, spectacles.
(tries to laugh)
As you see, I won't be needing them.
Imhotep opens the drawer and pulls out some bifocals. He puts
the bifocals on over his death mask, --and grins broadly, his
rotted teeth showing through the mouth hole.
BENI
Mister Burns, Prince Imhotep
thanks you for your spectacles,
- and for your eyes, ....and
for your tongue.
The expression on Burns' face starts to change, very puzzled.
BENI
But I am afraid more is needed,
the Prince says he must finish
the job, consummate the curse
which you and your friends have
brought down upon yourselves.
A look of pure fear registers on Burns, face. Beni quickly
backs away and runs out of the room. Imhotep picks up the
sacred canopic jar, then removes the death mask, revealing
his hideous, shattered CORPSE-SKULL.
INT. CASBAH - DAY
Three shot glasses clink together. O'Connell, Jonathan and
Henderson slug 'em down, --all three of them instantly SPIT
OUT the liquid. Half the bar SPITS OUT their drinks as well.
HENDERSON
Sweet Jesus! That tasted just
like, ....like...
O'CONNELL
Blood.
They all look at each other, even more nervous.
JONATHAN
"And the rivers and waters of
Egypt went red and were
as blood."
A look passes over O'Connell's face, a realization.
O'CONNELL
He's here 
He sudden1y jumps away from the bar and runs for the door.
JONATHAN
Who's here!?
O'CONNELL
The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
EXT. BRITISH FORT COMPOUND - DAY
LIGHTNING FLASHES as O'Connell races across the compound,
knocking several Soldiers out of his way, panic stricken.
O'CONNELL
Evelyn!! EVELYYYYNN!!!
EXT. BRITISH FORT COURTYARD - DAY
Evelyn calmly steps into a courtyard carrying a handful of
books. A BLAST OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING scares her. She drops
half the books. Then a HAND GRABS HER! She jumps again and
drops the rest of the books. It's O'Connell, breathing hard.
O'CONNELL
We got problems.
And that's when a barrage of HAIL AND FIRE slams into the
courtyard. O'Connell and Evelyn jump back. A water fountain
bursts into STEAM. A wooden trellis catches FIRE. O'Connell
and Evelyn run under the eaves as SOLDIERS, SERVANTS and
CAMELS run in every direction, trying to avoid the maelstrom.
O'CONNELL
He's here! I saw him! That thing
is here!
EVELYN
The creature!? Are you sure!?
O'Connell gives her an incredulous look and gestures at the
HAIL and FIRE.
O'CONNELL
Pretty sure!
The HAIL and FIRE come to a stop. Everything goes dead quiet.
O'Connell and Evelyn freeze. And then a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM
is heard coming from the living quarters directly above them.
O'Connell and Evelyn race up the stairs.
INT. BURNS' QUARTERS - DAY
O'Connell and Evelyn race into the room, past the Servant who
is running out SCREAMING. They skid to a stop as they spot
Burns, or what's left of him, lying dead on the floor, --HIS
BODY IS SHRIVELLED TO HALF IT'S SIZE. Drained of all organs
and liquids. O'Connell and Evelyn are shocked. Then they hear
a LOUD MOAN and notice Imhotep standing on the far side of
the room. O'Connell draws his gun.
Imhotep is REGENERATING: A thick skin FORMS over powerful new
musculature. His tendons RIPPLE. His bones BULGE and REFORM.
His mouth opens to an inhuman size as he MOANS and CRYS OUT,
in severe pain. And then it's over. And he looks like an
incredibly muscular, corpse-like vision from hell. The
'Terminator' Mummy. O'Connell and Evelyn are stunned.
O'CONNELL
we are in serious trouble.
Imhotep starts to move towards them, staring at Evelyn.
O'CONNELL
Back off, creep
Imhotep keeps coming. O'Connell OPENS FIRE. BLASTING Imhotep
Bullets RIP through his body. Imhotep doesn't seem to mind.
Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels run into the room. They're
all stunned at the sight of Imhotep.
O'Connell steps forward, throws a RIGHT HOOK, punches Imhotep
in the face, --HIS FIST GOES THROUGH IMHOTEPIS SKULL AND GETS
STUCK DEEP INSIDE HIS HEAD. O'Connell stares at it, shocked,
then quickly YANKS his fist back out. The area of Imhotep's
face that came into contact with O'Connell's fist quickly
DEGENERATES and DECAYS, right down to the bone, as if
O'Connell's hand instantly infected it.
Imhotep angrily turns, grabs O'Connell, and with no effort,
THROWS him across the room and into Jonathan and the others
knocking them down. Imhotep looks at his hand, the one that
just grabbed O'Connell, --IT STARTS TO SHRIVEL and DECAY.
He quickly turns to Evelyn. Evelyn backs away into a wall,
terrorized. Imhotep steps up to her.
IMHOTEP (subtitled)
You saved me from the undead.
For this, I shall make you immortal.
He leans in, about to kiss her with his decayed face.
And that's when a WHITE CAT jumps onto the piano, HISSING.
Imhotep SHRIEKS. The balcony doors BLOW OPEN. Imhotep spins
into a BLAST OF WIND AND SAND and SWIRLS out the doors. Gone.

O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and Daniels stand transfixed.
Henderson kneels next to Burns, shriveled body, horrified.
HENDERSON
The curse the curse

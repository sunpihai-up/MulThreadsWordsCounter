PART 1

The UNIVERSAL PICTURES globe spins. Then comes to a stop on the African
continent. A golden papyrus MAP of ANCIENT EGYPT rises up. WE PUSH IN on
it, towards a CITY along the Nile, it's name written in hierarchic. WE KEEP
PUSHING IN until the golden map turns to golden sand and we find ourselves
DESCENDING on this ancient Egyptian city. Only it's not ancient.
SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS.
TREBES - 2,134 B.C
Accompanied by a NARRATOR with a very thick Egyptian accent:
NARRATOR 
Thebes. City of the Living. Crown
jewel of Pharaoh Seti the First.
The CAMERA sets-down in an open plaza. An Arabian horse-drawn CHARIOT comes
barreling right at us, driven by PHARAOH SETI; an aristocratic, virile old
man. The chariot WIPES FRAME.
INT. ANCK-SU-NAMUN'S BALCONY WINDOW - PALACE - DUSK
Glaring out over the city at the setting sun is a handsome, muscular MAN
with intense, evil eyes. This is IMHOTEP.
NARRATOR 
Home of Imhotep, High Priest of
Osiris, Keeper of the Dead.
A gorgeous, olive-skinned goddess enters the outer foyer. It takes us a
moment to realize that the skin-tight dress she's wearing isn't a dress at
all, but rather her entire naked body has been PAINTED in the ancient
Egyptian manner She's a stunning sight to behold. This is ANCK-SU-NAMUN.
NARRATOR 
Birthplace of Anck-su-namun.
Pharaoh's Mistress. No other man was allowed
to touch her.
She makes her way through the ornate statuary. The CAMERA comes to a stop
on a CRACKED STONE FACE. A BEAT. And then it's eyes suddenly POP OPEN. It's
really a strange looking TATTOOED MAN. Several more of these hideous, bald
MEN stand nearby. They are the PRIESTS of Osiris. Imhotep's guys. Their
eyes watch Anck-su-namun vanish through the bedroom curtains. Anck-su-namun
embraces Imhotep, they kiss passionately, feverishly. Imhotep's hands roam
over her perfect body, smearing the paint. The Narrator's VOICE fills with
lust:
NARRATOR 
But for our love, we were willing to
risk life itself.
And we realize that the Narrator is actually Imhotep himself
on the other-side of the curtains, the bald Priests rush over and close the
doors. But just as they do, the doors suddenly BURST OPEN. Pharaoh angrily
strides in, looks at the Priests. The following DIALOGUE is in ANCIENT
EGYPTIAN, --SUBTITLED.)
PHARAOH
What are you doing here?
The Priests back away, scared shitless, obviously his arrival was
unexpected. Pharaoh strides for the curtains. Throws them back.
Anck-su-namun stands alone. Gives him a sexy smile. Pharaoh sees the
smeared body paint. Points his finger.
PHARAOH
WHO HAS TOUCHED YOU?!
From behind him, his sword is ripped out of its scabbard. Pharaoh spins
around. It's Imhotep. Pharaoh is shocked.
PHARAOH
Imhotep? .... My priest.
Behind him, Anck-su-namun lifts a dagger and plunges it into his back.
Pharaoh SCREAMS. Imhotep raises Pharaoh's sword. The hideous bald Priests
SLAM the doors and bolt them tight. Through the curtains, they see the
SHADOWS of Anck-su-namun and Imhotep stab away at Pharaoh. Suddenly, the
doors are RAMMED from the other side, --WHAM! Imhotep and Anck-su-namun
turn and look. --WHAM! The doors are RAMMED again. The two lovers share
desperate looks. --WHAM! The bald Priests run up and grab Imhotep and try
and pull him towards the balcony.
PRIESTS
Pharaoh's bodyguards!
Imhotep tries to break free, but Anck-su-namun rips Pharaoh's sword out of
his hand and pushes him towards the balcony.
ANCK-SU-NAMM
You must go. Save yourself.
Only you can resurrect me.
Imhotep's face fills with despair. The DOORS EXPLODE OPEN. MEN with
BLUE-TINTED SKIN and strange PUZZLE-TATTOOS over their bodies stride in,
armed to the teeth. These are the MUMIA. The Priests hustle Imhotep out
onto the dark balcony just as the Mumia rip through the curtains.
Anck-su-namun points at Pharaoh and hisses--
ANCK-SU-NAMUN
My body is no longer his temple!
She PLUNGES the sword into her own heart. out on the balcony, Imhotep's
mouth opens into a horrible silent scream .........
NARRATOR/IMHOTEP
For murdering Pharaoh, Anck-su-namun's body 
was to be cursed. And it was I, the High 
Priest, whose duty it was to curse it.
EXT. SAND DUNES - NIGHT
Imhotep leads-a TORCH-LIT procession across the dunes. Anck-su-namun's
mummy is carried by NUBIAN SLAVES. They pet her down in the sand along with
FIVE JEWEL ENCRUSTED JARS.
IMHOTEP 
Her body was mummified, her vital
organs removed and placed in sacred canopic
jars
Imhotep, filled with dread, reads from a OBOOKO made out of pure GOLD. THIS
IS THE BOOK OF THE LIVING.
IMHOTEP 
The Book of The Living contained
sacred incantations that would send the evil
dead on a journey into the dark underworld.
Strange LIGHT suddenly FLASHES across Anck-su-namun's body and across the
faces of the slaves and the EGYPTIAN SOLDIERS Suddenly, everyone's
fear-filled eyes all rise, as if watching Anck-su-namun's body rising. Then
one last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, and it's over.
Anck-su-namun's body now lies twisted on the ground.
Imhotep's Priests place the body into a stone sarcophagus. The Nubian
slaves lower it into a hole and bury it with sand Imhotep then signals to
the Soldiers, who throw their spears at the Nubians. Killing them.
INHOTEP

The slaves were killed....
Imhotep's knife-wielding Priests attack the now unarmed Soldiers, hacking
at them in the flickering darkness as Imhotep and the Mumia solemnly
watches.
IMHOTEP 
.... and the soldiers who killed them
were also slain, so that no unholy person
should ever know the exact location of the
burial site.
The Mumia walk off across the sand and then, one by one,
the Priests stop their frenzied stabbing and stare off at the
vanishing Mumia. As the last Mumia disappears over a distant
dune, Imhotep nods, and the Priests leap onto Anck-su-namun's
grave and begin digging it back up with their hands.
EXT. SAHARA DESERT - NIGHT
CHARIOTS race out into the moonlit desert. Imhotep leads the way. A
"hearse" carries Anck-su-namun's mummy. THE MAP OF ANCIENT EGYPT FADES UP.
The chariots race across the map.
IMHOTEP 
But there was another book, The Book
Of The Dead, which was never to-be opened,
never to be read, for it contained the
incantations that could bring a dead body
back to life a most unholy thing.
The chariots arrive at a place marked on the map in hieratic. They race up
the stone ramp and in through the city gates. SUPERIMPOSED across the
SCREEN are the WORDS:
KANUNAPTM - City of the Dead
IMHOTEP 
It was hidden at Hamunaptra, City of
the Dead, inside the statue of Anubis, so
that no such sacrilege might ever disgrace
Egypt.
EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - ANUBIS SITE - NIGHT
Imhotep pulls an ORNATE CHEST out of a SECRET COMPARTMENT inside the giant
STATUE OF ANUBIS. He opens the chest and lifts out THE BOOK OF THE DEAD,
made of black stone.
IMHOTEP 
But for my love of Anck-su-namun I
was willing to defy the gods.
INT- UNDERGROUND NECROPOLIS - NIGHT
Big hairy RATS scurry through the mausoleums and over the headstones of
this very large, scary, UNDERGROUND CEMETERY. A DETRITUS MOAT surrounds the
cemetery, --muck made out of filthy water and human remains. Skulls bob in
the goop. The Priests have gathered in a circle. Their hooded, lifeless
eyes seem dead to this world. Their bald heads rock back and forth as they
CHANT, a quiet eerie HUM. Heinous creatures. In the middle of the circle is
a strange, twisted ALTAR.' Imhotep has unwrapped Anck-su-namun's gorgeous,
lifeless body and placed her five sacred canopic jars around her.
IMHOTEP 
Anck-su-namun's vital organs were
still fresh, so a human sacrifice would not
need be made
As Imhotep begins to read from The Book of The Dead, a large SWIRLING HOLE
starts to open in the detritus bog. Several Priests look over at it,
frightened, then quickly look back down and resume CHANTING. A strange MIST
wafts up out of the swirling hole and over to the jars, it passes through
them and into Anck-su-namun's body. One of the jars SHUDDERS, the heart
inside begins to BEAT. The CHANTING PRIESTS, SWIRLING HOLE, WAFTING MIST,
BEATING HEART and IMHOTEP'S READINGS are reaching a crescendo.
Anck-su-namun's EYES suddenly FLY OPEN.
IMHOTEP 
Anck-su-namun soul had come back from
the dead! Now all that was needed, was to
return her organs to their rightful place
within her body.
Imhotep lifts a sacrificial knife above Anck-su-namun's breast, about to
plunge it down. The CHANTING, SWIRLING and BEATING heart CLIMAX. And that's
when the Mumia BURST IN and storm through the startled Priests. The HEAD
MUMIA SMASHES the jar with the beating heart. The MIST instantly sucks back
out of Anck-su-namun's body and IMPLODES back into the swirling hole.
Anck-su-namun's eyes close. Dying once again. Imhotep SCREAMS in rage. The
Mumia grab him and his Priests.
IMHOTEP 
My Priests were condemned to be
mummified alive.
INT. EMBALMF.RIS CHAMBER (necropolis re-vamp) - NIGHT
Inside a TORCH-LIT CHAMBER, Imhotep is held by Anubis-headed EMBALMERS. He
cringes at the flickering, impressionistic glimpses of his Priests being
embalmed and mummified alive. The horrid-looking Embalmers, using knives,
needles and thread, calmly perform their ghastly surgery on the SCREAMING
Priests, who are going insane from the procedure.
A red hot POKER is pulled out of a pit of burning coals.
A Priest's head is wedged between two strong boards. His eyes widen in
terror as an Embalmer moves to insert the red hot poker up his nose. But
just before he does, WE QUICKLY CUT TO IMHOTEP'S FACE, horrified, as OFF
CAMERA, the Priest SCREAMS.
WE GO WIDE on the chamber. All twenty-one of Imhotep's Priests squirm
inside their wrappings. Imhotep is forced to his knees. His arms are held
back. His mouth is pried open.
IMHOTEP 
As for me, I was condemned to endure
the HOM-DAI. The worst of all ancient curses.
one so horrible, it had never before been
bestowed.
Using a pair of tongs, an Embalmer slowly pulls Imhotep's TONGUE out of his
mouth, then places a very sharp knife on top of it. WE-GO TIGHT on
IMHOTEP'S EYES as his tongue is apparently cut out. The Embalmer flings
Imhotep's tongue onto the floor. The Mumia's dogs attack and quickly eat
it.
Imhotep is WRAPPED AL M . Only his mouth, nostrils and fear-filled eyes are
left free of the slimy bandages. Detritus muck boils inside a black
cauldron. Embalmers scoop out the fetid muck and apply it to Imhotep's
wrappings as he squirms. He's then laid in a wooden COFFIN inside a stone
SARCOPHAGUS. An Embalmer with a BUCKET steps up and looks into the coffin.
Imhotep's wild eyes stare back. The Embalmer empties the bucket over
Imhotep's chest: dozens of SCARABS, disgusting dung beetles. They scurry
across Imhotep's SCREAMING face. Some vanish into his tongue-less mouth
and up his nostrils.
INHOTEP 
By eating the sacred scarabs, I would
be cursed to stay alive forever. And by
eating me, they were cursed just the same.
The lid to the coffin is SLAMMED SHUT. Then, using a strange four-sided
YCEY, the Head Mumia locks the coffin lid tight. The heavy sarcophagus lid
is shoved into place and with a loud WHOOSH seals itself airtight. once
again, the Head Mumia uses the strange key, locking the sarcophagus lid
tight.
IMHOTEP 
I was to remain sealed inside my
sarcophagus, the undead for all of eternity.
The blue-skinned, strangely tattooed man carefully collapses the sides of
the key, --turning it into a little puzzle BOX.
INHOTEP 
They would never allow me to be
released. For I would arise a walking
disease, a plague upon mankind, an unholy
flesh-eater, with the strength of ages, power
over the sands, and the glory of
invincibility.
Imhotep's sarcophagus is dropped into a DETRITUS PIT. The disgusting muck
SPLASHES up, drools down it-s sides, and then is mysteriously sucked into
It's seams, vanishing clean.
INHOTEP 
And if I could raise my beloved
Anck-su-namun from her place in hell,
together, we would be an unstoppable
infection upon this world. The Apocalypse.
The End
Imhotep's horrifying tongue-less SCREANS can be heard coming from inside
his sarcophagus as grave diggers shovel dirt onto it. THE MAIN TITLE IS
SUPERIMPOSED ON THE SCREAM: THE MUMMY
The heavily armed Mumia stand guard around Imhotep's grave. Looking down on
the burial site is the huge statue of ANUBIS, the jackal-headed god of
death. it stares at us. Then begins to DECAY before bur very eyes, aging
4.159 years in only seconds. And then we find ourselves and the decrepit,
half-buried statue of Anubis out in the middle of the desert.
EXT. SAHARA - HAMANAPTRA RUINS (1925) - DAY
Imhotep's horrifying SCREAMS become the SCREAMS of a TUAREG HORSEMAN.
Racing across the desert with two thousand of his warrior brethren. Armed
to the teeth. SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS: TEE SARKRA -
1925
A mile across the scorching desert TWO HUNDRED FRENCH FOREIGN LEGIONNAIRES
scurry through the ruins, preparing for the onslaught. OUR HERO is up on
the wall. His Kepi sits at a jaunty angle. Dashing and handsome. This is
RICK O'CONNELL. He looks out at the massive SCREAMING horde galloping at
him.
O'CONNELL
I knew this was gonna be a lousy day.
A doughy little Frenchman joins him as he makes his way across the top of
the wall. This is BENI.
BENI 
Personally, I would like to surrender.
Why can we not just surrender?
O'CONNELL
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier,
Beni pulls off his cartridge belt. Hands it to O'Connell.
BENI 
Then let's run away. Right now. while we
can still make it.
O'Connell throws it on, crisscrossing his own bandolier.
O'CONNELL 
Now gimme your revolver, you'll
never use it anyway.
Beni pulls out his pistol and chucks it to O'Connell
BENI 
Then let's play dead, huh? Nobody ever
does that anymore
O'Connell slides it into his belt, next to his own revolver
O'CONNELL 
Now go find me a big stick.
BENI 
in the desert? What for?
O'Connell turns and goes nose-to-nose with him.
O'CONNELL 
So I can tie it to your back, you
appear to be without a spine
The horde of warriors THUNDERS forward. Now a half mile out. Scimitars
RATTLING. O'Connell and Beni run through the ruins.
O'CONNELL 
How'd a guy like you end up in the
Legion anyways?
BENI 
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots
of good stuff in them holy places; churches,
temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
O'CONNELL 
Altar boys?
BENI 
Exactly! I speak seven languages,
including Hebrew, so my specialty was
synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
Beni trips and accidentally tackles O'Connell to the ground. O'Connell
gives him a nasty look.
O'CONNELL 
No, but I'm considering it.
They get up and run out the gate and down the stone ramp
BENI
What then? Robbery? Extortion?
Kidnapping!
O'CONNELL
None of the above, thank you
BENI
Then what the hell are you
doing here!?
They both skid to a stop at the front line as they see the horde of
warriors.-The SOUND of CHARGING HORSES is deafening. O'Connell gives Beni a
big cheesy smile.
O'CONNELL
I was just looking for a good time.
And that's when the cowardly Legionnaire Colonel suddenly panics, cuts and
runs. O'Connell instantly stiffens.
O'CONNELL
Oh shit Steady!
Gives the men around him courage. But onward comes the horde Hoofs pounding
the sand. Several more Legionnaires take off.
O'CONNELL
STEADY!
(to himself)
What the hell am I sayin'?
The Tuaregs let loose with those horrifying oooo-loo-loog SCREAMS. More
Legionnaires haul-ass. Beni is one of them.
O'CONNELL
STEADY!!
(to himself)
What the hell am I doin'?
The Tuaregs set their rifles and take aim. O'Connell steels himself, cocks
and locks. The cartridge in his mouth suddenly snaps, he spits it into the
sand. Another BEAT. And then--
O'CONNELL
FIRE!
The Legionnaires on the ground FIRE. The rifles report with a CRASH. The
BLAST blows dozens of Tuaregs clean off their mounts. The prone
Legionnaires quickly begin to reload.
O'CONNELL
FIRE!
The kneeling Legionnaires FIRE. More Tuaregs bite the sand. The remaining
warriors OPEN FIRE. THUNDER and SMOKE rip the hot air. A third of the
Legionnaires are killed instantly.
O'CONNELL
FIRE!
The remaining standing Legionnaires FIRE. Tuaregs spin off their mounts.
Crash to the sand. And then the entire Tuareg force plows into the ruins
and through the Legionnaires. O'Connell grabs the barrel of his rifle and
starts CLUBBING riders off their steeds, fighting like a man possessed.
Beni on the other hand, is bellycrawling across the sand, whimpering in
full retreat as Legionnaires fall dead all around him. He crawls through
the front gate.
O'Connell throws his rifle down and goes for his guns. He cross-draws, gun
in each hand, starts blowing riders off their mounts.
Beni crawls faster, and then he spots an open TEMPLE DOORWAY amongst the
rocks. He gets up and sprints for the door as the last of the Legionnaires
are shot off their feet behind him. O'Connell's guns go empty.
O'CONNELL
Son-of-a-bitch.
He turns and runs like hell, right through the front gate. Four Tuareg
warriors on massive Arabians haul-ass after him. O'Connell hurdles a stone
column, hits the ground running. He spots Beni inside the Temple doorway,
trying to close the heavy sandstone door.
O'CONNELL
Hey! Beni! Wait up!
Beni has no intention of waiting up, he pushes harder.
O'CONNELL
What are ya doing?! Wait up!
O'Connell runs faster. Beni pushes harder. The four Horsemen LEAP the big
column and CHARGE after him. HOOFS POUNDING.
O'CONNELL
Don't you close that door!
DON'T YOU CLOSE TRAT DOOR!
Beni closes the door just as O'Connell reaches it. O'Connell SLAMS his body
into the door. It doesn't budge
O'CONNELL
I'm gonna get you for this!
He turns and bolts off around the rocks. Running for his life, weaving
through the ruins. The Arabians getting closer and closer. The POUNDING
hoofs getting LOUDER and LOUDER. O'Connell finally spins around and faces
his attackers. The four massive horses crash to a stop in front of him.
The vicious Tuaregs raise their rifles to finish him off. O'Connell just
stands there, exhausted and beaten, then he slowly lifts his right hand and gives them the bird.
And that's when the horses go ape-shit. All four of them REAR UP. Two of
the Riders are THROWN to the ground. The horses SCREECH and BELLOW and
SNORT in fear, then buck like fury and haul-ass away as if the devil
himself had scared them. The thrown Riders get up and race off after their
mounts.
O'Connell just stands there, stunned, then he lifts his right hand and
checks out his middle finger. And then he feels the evil himself, and turns
around. --The shattered, decrepit statue of Anubis stares back at him.
Suddenly, the sand begins to shift under O'Connell's feet. He starts to
back away, keeping his eyes on the transforming sand, it looks like huge
snakes are wiggling and writhing beneath it, forming lines and shapes,
--drawing a picture. O'Connell quickly turns and runs off through the
ruins. The sand stops moving, and we can now see that, drawn in the sand,
is a picture of IMHOTEP'S SCREAMING FACE.

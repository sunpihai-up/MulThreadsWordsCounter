PART 10

INT. FOYER - NIGHT
O'Connell and Jonathan race into the foyer and skid to a
stop as they see Henderson's shriveled body on the floor.
O'Connell runs up to Evelyn's door and rattles the knob,
still locked. He bends down and looks in through the KEYHOLE.
EVELYN'S ROOM - NIGHT
Imhotep leans down towards Evelyn, about to kiss her as she
sleeps. The door starts to CRASH and BANG from O'Connell.
Imhotep ignores it. And KISSES Evelyn. His lips and mouth
instantly start to DEGENERATE and DECAY. Right down to the
bone. The door BURSTS OPEN. Evelyn wakes-up. Sees Imhotep's
rotted mouth kissing her. She SCREAMS and shoves him away.
Imhotep's putrid mouth grimaces in sadness.
O'CONNELL
Get your hands off my girl, pal.
Imhotep's sadness turns to anger as he spins around and faces
O'Connell. Imhotep licks his fetid lips. O'Connell smirks.
O'CONNELL
Nice lips.
Imhotep starts to move for O'Connell.
O'CONNELL
I figured you might be here,
so I brought a friend.
He throws the white cat at Imhotep. Imhotep instinctively
catches it. He SHRIEKS, drops the cat and stumbles back
towards the window, --which suddenly BLOWS OPEN. Imhotep
spins like a dervish and BURSTS INTO A WHIRLWIND OF SAND.
Everybody covers their eyes. The Imhotep/sand-devil EXPLODES
out the window and vanishes over the compound.
Jonathan aims his gun at the window, his hand shaking badly.
O'Connell hugs Evelyn as she wipes her mouth in disgust.
Daniels walks in, looks at Henderson's shriveled body on
the floor . .... and drops the martini glasses.
INT. 1923 CONVERTIBLE DUSSENBERG - NIGHT
Jonathan races his big convertible through the streets,
HONKING constantly. Evelyn sits between him and O'Connell,
looking scared and nervous, then she gives O'Connell a look.
EVELYN
You called me your girl?
O'CONNELL
What? ... Oh yeah, that was just
um, you know, figure a speech.
EVELYN
I think you were jealous
O'CONNELL
Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did
you see that guy's face?
Daniels leans forward from the back seat, filled with fear,
DANIELS
Shut-up! JUST SHUT-UP! We gotta
do somethin'! we gotta do somethin,
NOW! Before it's too late!
They race into the driveway of the museum of Antiquities.
EXT. CAIRO BAZAAR - NIGHT
A FULL MOON now shines down on the bazaar, still bustling
with activity. Suddenly, a BREEZE kicks-in. GREEN MIST begins
to SWIRL down the street and through the stalls. The people
begin to CHOKE and COUGH and RETCH, as if being hit by a
severe sickness. --It's already too late.
Imhotep strolls through the sickened mob, his face half
rotted off, his deformed mouth grinning happily. Beni is
at his side, looking very nervous. And then, one-by-one',
the people silently begin to follow Imhotep, their skin
now covered in disgustingly hideous BOILS AND SORES.
INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - NIGHT
O'Connell., Jonathan, Daniels, the Curator and Ardeth Bay
fo11ow Evelyn as she strides through the museum.
EVELYN
Last month I came across an
inscription that mentioned
The Book Of The Dead.
DANIELS
That book we found at Hamunaptra?
EVELYN
Yes. I dismissed it, because it
talked about bringing people
back from the dead. A notion
I was unwilling to believe.
O'CONNELL
Believe it, sister. That's what
brought our buddy back to life.
JONATHAN
And now he's going to use it
to bring his girlfriend back
ARDETH BAY
And if he succeeds, the two of
them together will bring about
the apocalypse.
The Curator joins Evelyn at her side as she heads up the
stairs, everyone else in hot pursuit.
THE CURATOR
The plagues we have seen so far,
are merely Imhotep flexing his
muscles. only at the moment of
Anck-su-namun's resurrection
will he be truly invincible.
They reach the display cases. Evelyn quickly opens them.
EVELYN
I'm thinking that if the black
Book Of The Dead can bring people
back to life--
CURATOR
--then perhaps, the golden Book
Of The Living can return them
to the underworld.
EVELYN
Exactly -
O'CONNELL
So your sayin', if we find the
book made outta gold--
CURATOR
--And read the sacred incantations
contained inside it.
O'CONNELL
You think it'll send this guy
back to hell?
CURATOR
Correct,
And that's when LOUD CHANTING is heard coming from outside
They all rush over to the upper windows and look down--
OUTSIDE: A large, CRAZED MOB covered in hideous boils and sores
comes CHANTING up the driveway: 'Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!
ARDETH BAY
it has begun. The beginning of
the end.
EVELYN
Not quite yet it hasn't. C'mon,
Evelyn dashes back to the display cases. Everyone follows.
EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT
The crazed mob CRASHES into the huge front doors, which are
locked. They pound furiously, throwing themselves at it while
CHANTING CONSTANTLY. Imhotep solemnly comes up the driveway.
INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - UPPER BALCONY - NIGHT
The BANGING on the doors can be heard as Evelyn and the
Curator quickly sort through broken pieces of stone tablets.
The others watch. Evelyn pulls out a large piece.
EVELYN
Got it!
O'CONNELL
Got what?
The BANGING gets LOUDER. Multiple windows SHATTER. Evelyn
talks while quickly translating the tablet:
EVELYN
Since the black Book of The Dead
was found inside the statue of
Anubis, then according to this,
the golden Book of The Living
should be inside ........
Evelyn finds the translation in the tablet and smiles.
O'CONNELL
what?
JONATHAN
What?
DANIELS
WHAT!?
EVELYN
The golden Book Of The Living,
is inside the statue of Koz-us.
CURATOR
Which would be located not far to
the east of the Anubis statue.
O'CONNELL
Don't tell me we gotta go back
out there?
CURATOR
If we want to kill the creature, yes.
TWO HIDEOUS BOIL & SORE-COVERED MEN charge out of a doorway,
SCREAMING. O'Connell and Ardeth Bay grab them and chuck them
over the railing. The men fly through the air and CRASH into
the lower display cases. The front doors suddenly BURST OPEN,
The crazed mob pours into the museum. our heroes haul-ass
across the balcony and down the staircase.
EXT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITY - NIGHT
Jonathan sneaks out of some bushes and quickly heads for his
convertible. Suddenly, a splinter group of the diseased mob
comes around the side of the museum. Jonathan instantly bugs
his eyes out, starts drooling, and begins CHANTING---
JONATHAN
Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!
The crazed group runs past him and heads into the front doors
of the museum. Jonathan leaps into the convertible, fires it
up and 180's it back over to the bushes.
O'Connell, Evelyn, Daniels, Ardeth Bay and the Curator jump
inside the car. Beni steps out of the museum and sees them.
BENI
Imhotep! IMHOTEP!
Imhotep looks out of the museum from the shattered upper
windows just as the convertible PEELS OUT. O'Connell points a
finger at Beni as they race past him.
O'CONNELL
You're gonna get yours, pal!
Imhotep UNHINGES his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman
size, he lets out one of his horrific, primordial SHRIEKS.
His disease-ridden disciples immediately begin pouring out
of the front doors of the museum and chasing after the car.
EXT. BAZAAR - NIGHT
The convertible hauls-ass down the narrow bazaar street.
Crazies start jumping out of stalls and LEAPING onto the
car. O'Connell and the others fight them off, throwing them
overboard. More people JUMP on. Jonathan SWERVES the car,
CRASHES through some stalls, knocking them off, but not
before they manage to open the back door and YANK Daniels
out. He TUMBLES across the pavement. Gets up SHOOTING. Backs
into a corner, FIRING his pistol into the hideous rabble,
killing several, keeping them at bay. His gun goes empty,
CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! But the mob stays back, looking at him
like rabid vultures. Daniels eyes them, filled with fear.
The mob parts like the red sea as Imhotep walks through them
and up to Daniels. Daniels whimpers in fear, tears pour down
his cheeks. Then he gets an idea, reaches into his pocket,
and pulls out his jewel encrusted SACRED CANOPIC JAR. He
holds it out for Imhotep. Imhotep takes it and grins. Through
his tears, Daniels grins back, hopeful that he'll be spared.
WE CUT WIDE: Somewhere in the middle of the crazed, diseased
mob, we hear Daniels give out A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM ........
INT./EXT. CONVERTIBLE - STREETS - NIGHT
The convertible slowly motors down the narrow alleys. WE
DOLLY across the hood of the car from Jonathan to Evelyn to
O'Connell. Ardeth Bay and the Curator are still in the back.
All of them staring out the front windshield. Freaked-out.
Then suddenly one of the hideous ghouls CRASHES through the
windshield! Everybody SCREAMS. Jonathan hits the gas, loses
control, the car SLAMS into a wall. O'Connell grabs Evelyn.
O'CONNELL
C'mon! C'mon! Let's go! Let's go!

They all leap out of the car. But the angry, festering mob
quickly surrounds them. O'Connell quickly reaches into his
gunny-sack, pulls out a stick of dynamite, then reaches into
his pocket and pulls out a match. He looks around for a way
to light it, then reaches over and strikes it across Ardeth
Bay's stubbly face. Ardeth Bay YELPS. O'Connell holds the lit
match near the fuse.
The crazed, CHANTING mob gives O'Connell a wide berth,
staring at him and the others with insane, bloodshot eyes.
And then Imhotep steps through, --having fully regenerated,
he now looks as young and handsome and muscular as he did the
day he was buried alive. Evelyn stares at him.
EVELYN
He's gorgeous.
O'Connell gives her a look, the match burns his fingers. He
YELPS and throws it down, grabs another match and strikes it
across Ardeth Bay's face again. Ardeth Bay YELPS and gives
O'Connell a look to kill. The Curator shakes his head.
THE CURATOR
He has consummated the curse,
now all he need do is raise
Anck-su-namun from the dead,
then it will be the end of us,
and the beginning for them.
Imhotep moves forward, heading right for them. O'Connell
LIGHTS THE FUSE. Imhotep steps up to O'Connell and stops,
watching the fuse burn down. it's a game of chicken. The
tension mounts. The LIT FUSE is about to vanish inside the
stick of dynamite, blowing it up, --when Evelyn leans forward
and blows it out. O'Connell exhales, but keeps his eyes on
Imhotep, who extends his hand to Evelyn.
IMHOTEP
Koontash dai na.
Beni steps through the swarming mass, translating.
BENI
Take his hand and he will
spare the others.
Evelyn hesitates, looks around at the huge, bloodthirsty
crowd surrounding them, holding axes, picks and scimitars,
waiting to pounce, then she looks at Imhotep, confident,
powerful, invincible. Then she looks at O'Connell.
EVELYN
Any bright ideas?

O'Connell talks through angry, grit teeth.
O'CONNELL
Sorry, fresh out.
Evelyn looks back at Imhotep, then starts to reach out to
take his hand. Both O'Connell and Jonathan move to stop her,
--but Ardeth Bay grabs them both and holds them tight.
O'CONNELL

Don't do it, Evelyn.

EVELYN
I have no choice.
Evelyn's trembling hand touches Imhotep's: His hand closes
around hers. Nothing happens. Imhotep smiles.
IMHOTEP
Keetah mi pharos, aja nilo, isirlan.
BENI
Come with me my princess. It is
time to make you mine, forever.
Evelyn gives Beni a nasty look, correcting him--
EVELYN
All eternity, idiot,
Then she looks at O'Connell and puts on her best face.
EVELYN
You better think of something,
because if he turns me into a
mummy, your the first one I'm
coming after.
O'Connell almost smiles
O'CONNELL
Got guts, lady.
EVELYN
Yes, I know, and I'd like to
keep them.
Imhotep suddenly notices something. He reaches forward and--
RIPS THE KEY/BOX OUT OF JONATHAN'S UPPER JACKET POCKET.
JONATHAN
Hey that's mine--!
Ardeth Bay holds Jonathan back. Imhotep pulls Evelyn away.
O'Connell can't take it anymore, he tries to break free of
Ardeth Bay's grip.
O'CONNELL
Evelyn!
The huge, powerful man holds him tight.
ARDETH BAY
Be calm. There is still time.
we can stop him yet.
The crowd parts for Imhotep and Evelyn. And then Imhotep
stops and looks back at O'Connell.
IMHOTEP
Pared oos.
Evelyn SCREAMS.
EVELYN
NOOO!!
Beni smiles.
BENI
Kill them.
Imhotep pulls her away. O'Connell breaks free of Ardeth Bay's
grip and stumbles forward.
O'CONNELL
EVELYN!
But the rabid vultures are already moving in for the kill.
O'Connell quickly bends down, pulls open a CISTERN/MANHOLE
COVER and shoves Jonathan down inside it, then jumps in after
him. The Curator pushes Ardeth Bay towards the cistern hole.
CURATOR
Go! Find a way! Kill the creature!
The Curator turns and throws himself at the mob as Ardeth Bay
crawls down into the hole. The mob tears the Curator apart.

PART 13

INT. CEMETERY - DAY
Imhotep READS from the Book. The rotten Priest-mummies rock
back and forth, CHANTING. Evelyn struggles.
Then suddenly, the strange MIST wafts up out of the swirling
hole and over to the sacred jars, it passes through them and
into Evelyn. Evelyn JERKS as though she's been electrified.
The MIST passes through her and into Anck-su-namun's body.
The CHANTING PRIESTS, SWIRLING HOLE, WAFTING MIST and
IMHOTEPIS READINGS reach a crescendo. Anck-su-namun's crusty
EYELIDS suddenly POP OPEN. Evelyn stares at her in disbelief.
Anck-su-namun's rotted head turns and looks at Evelyn with
empty sockets. Evelyn freaks out and struggles wildly, then
she notices Imhotep holding the ancient sacrificial knife.
IMHOTEP (subtitled)
with your death, my love and
I will be invincible!
He raises it up over Evelyn's chest, about to plunge it down.
Evelyn's eyes widen in horror And that's when O'Connell
and Jonathan BURST IN. Imhotep spins around and faces them.
Jonathan beams as he holds up the golden Book Of The Living.
JONATHAN
I found it, Evy! I found it
EVELYN
Shut-up and get me off of here!
O'Connell grabs an ancient sword out of a statue's hand,
jumps up onto a gravestone and leaps out over the Priests.
The Priest-mummies stop chanting. The MIST vanishes.
Imhotep steps forward. O'Connell STRIKES the sacrificial
knife out of his hand. Imhotep BELLOWS a command. The Priests
stand up, swords and knives in hand, they ATTACK O'Connell.
EVERYTHING HAPPENS AT ONCE, READ FASTER:
EVELYN
Open the book, Jonathan! Open
the book! That's the only way
to kill him!
O'Connell RACKS and CHOPS at the attacking Priest-mummies,
fighting his way to Evelyn. The skeletal creatures wildly
SWING their swords, trying to STAB O'Connell. Jonathan
fumbles with the book, struggling to open it, --he can't.
JONATHAN
I can't open it! It's locked
or something!
O'Connell CUTS two of the mummies in half, then swings his
sword down at Evelyn, --CLANG! One chain breaks free.
Jonathan spots a series of SOLID GOLD, FOUR-SIDED LOCKS
along the binder. It hits him like lightning--
JONATHAN
We need the key!
Imhotep grins, then grabs the KEY/BOX hanging from a chain
around his neck, rips it off and shoves it into his pocket
He picks up the sacrificial sword and heads for Jonathan.
JONATHAN
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
EVELYN
Read the inscription on the cover!
O'Connell swings his sword down again, --CLANG! Evelyn now
has one hand and one leg free. More mummies attack O'Connell
force him back.
Jonathan quickly starts translating the cover inscription,
but his ancient Egyptian is clearly awful.
JONATHAN
.Keetash-something, naraba-something.
Jonathan starts to backpedal through the cemetery, clutching
the golden book; wide-eyed, as Imhotep moves in on him.
JONATHAN
Ebarra im hatu Kashka ummmmm--?
Jonathan trips and falls on his ass. Imhotep CHARGES FORWARD.
O'Connell SLASHES another chain. Only one more left holding
Evelyn. Jonathan sits up and quickly looks back at the cover.
JONATHAN
Rasheem Aaaaa ANUBIS!
Imhotep raises the sacrificial sword, about to kill Jonathan.
And that's when the giant statue of Anubis suddenly CRASHES
through the wall, --shades of Ray Harryhausen. only better.
The god of Deaths, horrible, decrepit STONE FACE stares
angrily down. Jonathan stares back.
JONATHAN
Oh boy
O'Connell DECAPITATES a mummy and looks up at Anubis.
O'CONNELL (sarcastic)
This just keeps gettin,
better and better.
Imhotep leaves Jonathan and heads for the giant statue.
O'Connell leaps over and with one last swing of the sword,
frees Evelyn from her chains. More Priest-mummies attack,
forcing him away. Evelyn jumps off the altar and starts to
head for O'Connell, --a SKELETAL HAND grabs her! Spins her
around. It's Anck-su-namun's rotted corpse. Evelyn reacts.

Imhotep looks up at Anubis, points to O'Connell, and in
ANCIENT EGYPTIAN commands him to attack. Anubis moves for
O'Connell, STOMPING over mausoleums and through the detritus
moat on his way. O'Connell quickly backs away.
O'CONNELL
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!
JONATHAN
You have got to be joking?
Evelyn is backing away from Anck-su-namun.
EVELYN
Finish the inscription, idiot!
JONATHAN
Oh.
Anck-su-namun ATTACKS Evelyn. Evelyn fends her off as best
she can. Jonathan quickly looks back at the hieroglyphs on
the book cover, fumbling badly under the pressure-
JONATHAN
Ummm, Hootash im .... Hootash
im now what is this
last symbol here?
EVELYN
What's it look like!?
Anck-su-namun grabs Evelyn by the throat. The statue of
Anubis corners O'Connell, reaches down and GRABS him with
it's MASSIVE TALONS. O'Connell HACKS away at it. Jonathan
stares at the inscription, slightly oblivious.
JONATHAN
It's an Anck symbol, with two
little squiggly lines above it,
and a bird, a stork! on either side,
Evelyn is being STRANGLED by Anck-su-namun,
EVELYN
-Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
JONATHAN
Yes, ...I see.
The talons lift O'Connell up and start to CRUSH him.
JONATHAN
Hootash im Ahmenophus!
The giant statue of Anubis instantly freezes in it's tracks
and PETRIFIES. It's off balance. Starts to fall. O'Connell
slides free of it's talons. Evelyn SHOVES Anck-su-namun away,
Anck-su-namun looks up and opens her fetid mouth to scream
just as Anubis CRASHES DOWN on top of her, SMASHING HER to
powder and DRIVING her into the ground.
Imhotep SHRIEKS in rage and horror, then turns and angrily
heads for Jonathan. Jonathan, sitting on his ass, quickly
backpedals on his hands and heels.
O'Connell leaps to his feet, sword in hand and runs for
Imhotep. Imhotep grabs Jonathan, lifts him up, rips the
golden Book Of The Living out of his hand and pins him to a
wall.
O'Connell runs up and swings his sword at Imhotep, --WAP!
SLICES Imhotep's 'right arm off. It drops to the ground, still
clutching The Book Of The Living. Imhotep drops Jonathan and
spins around, facing O'Connell. O'Connell grins.
O'CONNELL
Okay pal, let's see how tough
you are without your right arm.
Imhotep grabs O'Connell with his left arm and THROWS him half
way across the cemetery. O'Connell SLAMS into a gravestone,
bounces off and crashes to the ground. He shakes it off.
O'CONNELL
Alright, ...so he's left handed
Imhotep is already striding towards him. Jonathan lifts up
his hand, --HE HAS THE KEY/BOX BACK! He smiles at Evelyn.
JONATHAN
I got it!
Evelyn runs for Jonathan.
O'Connell SWINGS his sword and CLEAVES a big chunk of molten
flesh rot out of Imhotep's stomach. on the outside, Imhotep
looks human, but on the inside he is still a rotten old mummy.
Imhotep BACKHANDS O'Connell. Knocks him twenty feet back.
O'Connell staggers to his feet. Imhotep is right there. CLUBS
him hard with his left arm. O'Connell spins through the air,
SLAMS into the side of a mausoleum. Imhotep approaches, rage
in his eyes. O'Connell gets up, quickly pivots and HACKS into
Imhotep's head. Imhotep grins and PUNCHES O'Connell in the
face. O'Connell is thrown back, pulling his sword with him.
He bounces hard off the mausoleum. Lands on his feet.
Totally beat-to-shit. Knees buckling. He can barely stand.
Jonathan lifts up the heavy gold book, --Imhotep's severed
hand still clings to it. Jonathan cringes in disgust. Evelyn
yanks it off, throws it away, then start furiously working
the key into the series of locks, unlocking each of them.
Imhotep strides forward. O'Connell backs into the mausoleum,
swings the sword, Imhotep tries to catch it, --it CLEAVES
through his palm and deeply imbeds itself into his forearm.
No matter, Imhotep rips the sword away from O'Connell and
casually flings it away.
The golden Book Of The Living opens with a HISS. Jonathan
holds it tight as Evelyn quickly turns the heavy gold pages
Looking for something.
O'Connell turns to run, but Imhotep grabs him by the throat
and lifts him off his feet. O'Connell hangs there, a dazed
mess. Imhotep grins, says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN, then
starts to strangle O'Connell. O'Connell chokes. About to die.
Evelyn turns and faces Imhotep and reads an inscription:
EVELYN
Kadeesh mal! Kadeesh mal!
Pared oos! PARED OOS!!
Imhotep pivots and looks at Evelyn, a look of sheer terror
on his face. Then he looks over at the detritus bog. Which
starts to BUBBLE and SHIFT. The SWIRLING HOLE begins to open.
And then suddenly THE SPIRITS OF THE EGYPTIAN GODS waft out
of the black bog and SWIRL around the Priest-mummies. The
mummies all collapse and turn to dust. And then the spirits
attack Imhotep. Lifting him and O'Connell up into the air.
Imhotep let's go of O'Connell, who falls to the ground.
Evelyn and Jonathan fearfully stumble away from the spirits,
Jonathan trips and falls and accidentally throws The Book of
The Living into the detritus bog. Evelyn watches as the
golden book sinks into the black putrescence. Jonathan looks
like he's about to cry.
Ten feet off the ground, the spirits SWIRL around Imhotep's
body, TWISTING IT and TURNING IT and slowly SHRIVELING IT.
Accompanied by the same strange FLASHING LIGHT we saw at the
beginning of the movie when Anck-su-namun was cursed. one
last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, and Imhotep
is spit out and thrown to the floor. He staggers to his feet,
he looks perfectly normal. His body is completely intact.
O'Connell swings his sword. Imhotep jerks back. The sword
scrapes Imhotep's chest, --a swath of blood appears across
Imhotep's chest where the sword hit him. Imhotep touches the
blood on his chest, amazed and horrified. He's mortal.
O'Connell runs Imhotep through with the sword and shoves him
backwards. Imhotep stumbles back and falls into the detritus
bog. The sword still in his stomach.
Evelyn and Jonathan run up next to O'Connell. They watch as
Imhotep gently sinks into the fetid swamp, slowly dying. And
then, just before his head goes under, Imhotep looks up at
them, grins broadly, and says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.
Evelyn translates:
EVELYN
Death is only the beginning.
Imhotep's grinning face vanishes under the black bile
STAFF CHAMBER - DAY
Beni staggers across a chamber, straining under the weight
of another saddlebag filled with treasure. He spots a large,
ornate STAFF sticking out of a wall. He throws the saddlebag
over the staff and collapses against the wall. Exhausted.
A BEAT. And then the weight of the treasure PULLS THE STAFF
DOWN. Which starts a massive AURAL CHAIN-REACTION.
Beni-backs away from the wall, wide-eyed, filled with fear.
ALL THE WALLS START TO SINK INTO THE GROUND. Driven by tons
of pouring sand. Beni turns and hauls-ass out of the chamber.
CEMETERY - DAY
O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan look around as all the walls
start to DESCEND. O'Connell grabs Evelyn's hand.
O'CONNELL
C'mon!
He pulls her forward and all three of them race past sinking
pillars. They duck as they run into a descending doorway.
INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY
Beni scampers down a passageway, the ceiling getting lower
and lower until he has to crouch. And then he has to stick
the TORCH between his teeth and crawl on his hands and knees
INT. TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY
O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch-run into the treasure
chamber. Evelyn skids to a stop. Looks in wonder at all the
treasure. SAND rains down on them. O'Connell grabs her again
and quickly pulls her through the mounds of treasure towards
a SINKING DOORWAY on the far side of the room. The SOUND of
the sinking walls is deafening.
Beni crouch-runs into the treasure chamber. O'Connell, Evelyn
and Jonathan race past him. He joins them as they run up a
staircase. heading for a DESCENDING DOORWAY, which is already
half gone, it's now only four feet high -- now three feet
high -- now two feet. Jonathan dives through the narrow gap.
Then O'Connell dives through, he spins around. Evelyn dives,
but gets stuck in the middle, about to get cut in half.
O'Connell grabs her arm and YANKS her through in the nick of
time. Beni reaches through the narrowing gap with his hand--
BENI
O'CONNELL!!
O'Connell grabs it, but it's too late. Beni yanks his hand
back just as the top of the door CRASHES to the floor.
Sealing him in. Beni quickly crawls back down the stairs as
the ceiling SLAMS down behind him. He stands up and looks
around with his diminishing torch.
All the doorways FINISH CLOSING. There's no way out. He's
trapped. And then he hears something, and turns around. Over
in the corner, a scarab-beetle stares at him, CHITTERING.
Beni waves his flickering torch at the scarab and backs away.
BENI
Go away
He stands in the middle of the treasure chamber as dozens
upon dozens of scarabs boil up out of the floor around him.
Beni is absolutely terrified. The scarabs start to move in.
And that's when Beni's torch goes out. PITCH BLACK. A BEAT.
And then we hear Beni start SCREAMING in horror and pain.
And the scarabs CHITTERING hungrily.
EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY
The temple COLLAPSES as O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and a
pack of stray camels race through the ruins. A SINKING
CREVICE DROPS OUT right behind them. Chasing them out through
the front gates. The whole place RUMBLES ominously.
They make it down the ramp as more ruins CRASH DOWN behind
them. A MASSIVE CLOUD OF SAND AND DUST billows out over the
wall and into the air. our heroes and all the stray camels
race out into the desert ..........
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. PLATEALT - DAY
O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan stand in the middle of the
plateau, surrounded by stray camels. They stare off at the
sandy, dusty, volcano as it continues to RUMBLE-ominously.

JONATHAN
Well, ...I guess we go home
empty handed.
O'Connell looks at Evelyn
O'CONNELL
Wouldn't say that.
Evelyn returns the look, A BEAT, and then she wraps-her
arms around his neck and kisses him. O'Connell ret urn s it.
Jonathan just rolls his eyes, snorts in disgust and climbs
up onto a camel.
When the kiss is-over, O'Connell and Evelyn share a smile,
then O'Connell leaps up into the saddle, reaches down, grabs
Evelyn's hand and pulls her up behind him. Evelyn wraps her
arms around his waist. O'Connell and Jonathan slap the reins.
O'CONNELL/JONATHAN
TUK-TUK-TUK!!
The camels start to move out. WE PAN DOWN: to the saddlebag
behind Evelyn, hidden under the closed back flap, --we can
see that it's filled with Beni's stolen TREASURE.
O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan ride off into the SUNSET.

THE END
